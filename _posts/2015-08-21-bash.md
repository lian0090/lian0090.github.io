#grep

`rm $(ls|grep simulation[1-9]\.[oe])`


#sed 
sed is the stream editor, in that you can use | (pipe) to send standard streams (STDIN and STDOUT specifically) through sed and alter them programmatically on the fly, making it a handy tool in the Unix philosophy tradition; but can edit files directly, too, using the -i parameter mentioned below.

Consider the following:

for pipe

echo few and few | sed 's/few/asd/g'

for inplace file replacement 

sed -i -e 's/few/asd/g' hello.txt

/g stands for "global", meaning to do this for the whole line. If you leave off the /g (with s/few/asd/, there always needs to be three slashes no matter what) and few appears twice on the same line, only the first few is changed to asd.

sed can also use a different seperator, for example, the following seperator will be #

echo few and few | sed 's#few#asd#g', which returns asd and asd

#awk
print whole line to tmp file
echo "a b"|awk '{print  > "tmp"}'
