	Abstract = {Missing marker and segregation distortion are commonly encountered in actual quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping populations. Our objective in this study was to investigate the impact of the two factors on QTL mapping through computer simulations. Results indicate that detection power decreases with increasing levels of missing markers, and the false discovery rate increases. Missing markers have greater effects on smaller effect QTL and smaller size populations. The effect of missing markers can be quantified by a population with a reduced size similar to the marker missing rate. As for segregation distortion, if the distorted marker is not closely linked with any QTL, it will not have significant impact on QTL mapping; otherwise, the impact of the distortion will depend on the degree of dominance of QTL, frequencies of the three marker types, the linkage distance between the distorted marker and QTL, and the mapping population size. Sometimes, the distortion can result in a higher genetic variance than that of non-distortion, and therefore benefits the detection of linked QTL. A formula of the ratio of genetic variance explained by QTL under distortion and non-distortion was given in this study, so as to easily determine whether the segregation distortion marker (SDM) increases or decreases the QTL detection power. The effect of SDM decreases rapidly as its linkage relationship with QTL becomes looser. In general, distorted markers will not have a great effect on the position and effect estimations of QTL, and their effects can be ignored in large-size mapping populations.},

	Abstract = {Environmental factors greatly affect the activity of soil microorganisms. However, not enough is known about how the environment affects the abundance and activity of many beneficial microorganisms after they are released into soil. Hirsutella minnesotensis is an important fungal parasite of nematodes and has shown great potential in nematode control. The objective of this study was to measure the effects of environmental factors on the abundance and activity of H. minnesotensis in soil. Fungal mycelium was mixed with dry soil (1% wet weight per dryweight) and placed into 50-mL plastic tubes. Soil temperature ranged from 5 to 30 degrees C; soil water content ranged from 6% to 22%; and the soil was supplemented with 0-70% of fine soil particles (silt and clay) or sand. After 24 days, fungal abundance was quantified by real-time PCR and its activity was inferred from the numbers of second-stage juveniles (J2) parasitized. The amount of H. minnesotensis DNA g(-1) soil and the percentage of J2 parasitized by H. minnesotensis were higher with lower soil temperature and water content, and higher fine particle content, demonstrating that H. minnesotensis has a greater potential to multiply and control pest nematodes in cooler, drier and heavier soils.},

	Abstract = {A real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify in soil the fungus Hirsutella minnesotensis, an important parasite of secondary-stage juvenile 02) of the soybean cyst nematode. A primer pair 5'-GGGAGGCCCGGTGGA-3' and 5'-TGATCCGAGGTCAACTTCTGAA-3' and a TaqMan probe 5'-CGTCCGCCGTAAAACGCCCAAC-3' were designed based on the sequence of the ITS region of the rRNA gene. The primers were highly species-specific. The PCR reaction system was very sensitive and able to detect as few as 4 conidia g(-1) soil. Regression analysis showed similar slopes and efficiency on DNA from pure culture (y=-3.587x+41.017, R-2=0.9971, E=0.9055) and from Log conidia g(-1) soil (y=-3.855x+37.669, R-2 = 0.9139, E = 0.8172), indicating that the real-time PCR protocol can reliably quantify H. minnesotensis in the soil. The real-time PCR assay was applied to 20 soil samples from soybean fields, and compared with a parasitism assay. The real-time PCR assay detected H. minnesotensis in six of the soils, whereas the parasitism assay detected H. minnesotensis in the same six soils and three additional soils. The real-time PCR assay was weakly correlated (R-2 = 0.49) with the percentage of parasitized J2 in the six soils, indicating that different types of soil may interfere the efficiency of the real-time PCR assay, possibly due to the effect of soil types on efficacy of DNA extraction. The parasitism assay appeared to be more sensitive than real-time PCR in detecting presence of H. minnesotensis, but real-time PCR was much faster and less costly and provided a direct assessment of fungal biomass. Using the two assays in combination can obtain more complete information about the fungus in soil than either assay alone. Hirsutella parasitism was widespread and detected in 13 of the 20 field soils, indicating that these fungi may contribute to suppressiveness of soybean cyst nematode in nature and likely have high biological control potential for the nematode.

	Abstract = {Colonization of plant roots by root knot and cyst nematodes requires a functional ethylene response pathway. However, ethylene plays many roles in root development and whether its role in nematode colonization is direct or indirect, for example lateral root initiation or root hair growth, is not known. The temporal requirement for ethylene and localized synthesis of ethylene during the life span of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) on soybean roots was further investigated. Although a significant increase in ethylene evolution was not detected from SCN-colonized roots, the concentration of the immediate precursor to ethylene, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), was higher in SCN-colonized root pieces and root tips than in other parts of the root. Moreover, expression analysis of 17 ACC synthase (ACS) genes indicated that a select set of ACS genes is expressed in SCN-colonized root pieces that is clearly different from the set of genes expressed in non-colonized roots or root tips. Semi-quantitative real-time PCR indicated that ACS transcript accumulation correlates with the high concentration of ACC in root tips. In addition, an ACS-like sequence was found in the public SCN nucleotide database. Acquisition of a full-length sequence for this mRNA (accession GQ389647) and alignment with transcripts for other well-characterized ACS proteins indicated that the nematode sequence is missing a key element required for ACS activity and therefore probably is not a functional ACS. Moreover, no significant amount of ACC was found in any growth stage of SCN that was tested.},

	Abstract = {We collected 555 isolates of Cadophora gregata from adzuki bean field soils in Hokkaido, Japan, from 1997 to 2000. To identify the brown stem rot (BSR) pathogen C. gregata f. sp. adzukicola, we screened these isolates for pathogenicity to adzuki beans. Of the isolates, all of which originated in Tokachi District, Hokkaido, Japan, 23 were avirulent to adzuki bean, soybean, or mung bean. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers for C. gregata f. sp. adzukicola (BSRA1 and BSRA2) detected the specific identifying DNA fragment in these isolates, and cluster analysis with inter-simple sequence repeat markers showed that the isolates were phylogenetically closer to strains that are virulent to adzuki bean. Thus, we concluded that the isolates were nonpathogenic C. gregata. A few selected isolates of the nonpathogenic C. gregata were effective at reducing BSR in vivo and show potential for development as biological control agents. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Nematode parasitism genes encode secreted effector proteins that play a role in host infection. A homologue of the expressed Hg4F01 gene of the root-parasitic soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, encoding an annexin-like effector, was isolated in the related Heterodera schachtii to facilitate use of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model host. Hs4F01 and its protein product were exclusively expressed within the dorsal oesophageal gland secretory cell in the parasitic stages of H. schachtii. Hs4F01 had a 41% predicted amino acid sequence identity to the nex-1 annexin of C. elegans and 33% identity to annexin-1 (annAt1) of Arabidopsis, it contained four conserved domains typical of the annexin family of calcium and phospholipid binding proteins, and it had a predicted signal peptide for secretion that was present in nematode annexins of only Heterodera spp. Constitutive expression of Hs4F01 in wild-type Arabidopsis promoted hyper-susceptibility to H. schachtii infection. Complementation of an AnnAt1 mutant by constitutive expression of Hs4F01 reverted mutant sensitivity to 75mM NaCl, suggesting a similar function of the Hs4F01 annexin-like effector in the stress response by plant cells. Yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed a specific interaction between Hs4F01 and an Arabidopsis oxidoreductase member of the 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase family, a type of plant enzyme demonstrated to promote susceptibility to oomycete pathogens. RNA interference assays that expressed double-stranded RNA complementary to Hs4F01 in transgenic Arabidopsis specifically decreased parasitic nematode Hs4F01 transcript levels and significantly reduced nematode infection levels. The combined data suggest that nematode secretion of an Hs4F01 annexin-like effector into host root cells may mimic plant annexin function during the parasitic interaction.},

	Abstract = {Application of organic soil amendments is a traditional control method for plant-parasitic nematodes and it is considered a part of nematode-management programs. A variety of organic amendments, such as animal and green manures, compost, nematicidal plants and proteinous wastes, are used for this purpose, but nematode control efficacy is not always satisfactory. Elucidation of nematode-control mechanisms in amended soil may lead to improved efficacy or the development of more effective control techniques, although the effects of organic amendments on nematodes, microbial communities, plants and soil environments are very complex. Possible mechanisms involved in nematode suppression are: (1) release of pre-existing nematicidal compounds in soil amendments, (2) generation of nematicidal compounds, such as ammonia and fatty acids, during degradation, (3) enhancement and/or introduction of antagonistic microorganisms, (4) increase in plant tolerance and resistance, and (5) changes in soil physiology that are unsuitable for nematode behavior. Combinations of these mechanisms, rather than a single one, appear to produce nematode suppression in amended soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Production of stable transgenic plants is one factor that limits rapid evaluation of tissue specific transgene expression. To hasten the assessment of transgenes in planta, we evaluated the use of chimeric soybean seedlings expressing transgenic products in roots. Tap roots from four-day old seedlings (cultivars 'Jack' and KS4704) were excised and hairy roots were induced from hypocotyls via Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. Inoculated hypocotyls were screened on a MS-based medium containing either 200 mg/L kanamycin or 20 mg/L hygromycin. Beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity assay indicated that highest GUS expression was observed in hypocotyls exposed to a 4-d pre-inoculation time, a neutral pH (7.0) for the co-cultivation medium. A 170-bp of the Fib-1 gene and 292-bp of the Y25C1A.5 gene fragments, both related to nematode reproduction and fitness, were cloned independently into pANDA35HK vector using a Gateway cloning strategy. The resulting RNAi constructs of the genes fragments were transformed into soybean using the chimeric hairy root system and evaluated for its effect on soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) fecundity. Confirmation of transformation was attained by polymerase chain reaction and Southern-blot analysis, and some potential for suppression of H. glycines reproduction was detected for the two constructs. This method takes on average four weeks to produce chimeric plants ready for transgene analysis.},

	Abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars varied in their resistance to different populations of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, called HG Types. The rhg1 locus on linkage group G was necessary for resistance to all HG types. However, the loci for resistance to H. glycines HG Type 1.3- (race 14) and HG Type 1.2.5- (race 2) of the soybean cyst nematode have varied in their reported locations. The aims were to compare the inheritance of resistance to three nematode HG Types in a population segregating for resistance to SCN and to identify the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL). 'Hartwig', a soybean cultivar resistant to most SCN HG Types, was crossed with the susceptible cultivar 'Flyer'. A total of 92 F5-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs; or inbred lines) and 144 molecular markers were used for map development. The rhg1 associated QTL found in earlier studies were confirmed and shown to underlie resistance to all three HG Types in RILs (Satt309; HG Type 0, P = 0.0001 R (2) = 22%; Satt275; HG Type 1.3, P = 0.001, R (2) = 14%) and near isogeneic lines (NILs; or iso-lines; Satt309; HG Type 1.2.5-, P = 0.001 R (2) = 24%). A new QTL underlying resistance to HG Type 1.2.5- was detected on LG D2 (Satt574; P = 0.001, R (2) = 11%) among 14 RILs resistant to the other HG types. The locus was confirmed in a small NIL population consisting of 60 plants of ten genotypes (P = 0.04). This QTL (cqSCN-005) is located in an interval previously associated with resistance to both SDS leaf scorch from 'Pyramid' and 'Ripley' (cqSDS-001) and SCN HG Type 1.3- from Hartwig and Pyramid.

	Abstract = {Background: The Soybean Consensus Map 4.0 facilitated the anchoring of 95.6% of the soybean whole genome sequence developed by the Joint Genome Institute, Department of Energy, but its marker density was only sufficient to properly orient 66% of the sequence scaffolds. The discovery and genetic mapping of more single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were needed to anchor and orient the remaining genome sequence. To that end, next generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping were combined to obtain a much higher resolution genetic map that could be used to anchor and orient most of the remaining sequence and to help validate the integrity of the existing scaffold builds. Results: A total of 7,108 to 25,047 predicted SNPs were discovered using a reduced representation library that was subsequently sequenced by the Illumina sequence-by-synthesis method on the clonal single molecule array platform. Using multiple SNP prediction methods, the validation rate of these SNPs ranged from 79% to 92.5%. A high resolution genetic map using 444 recombinant inbred lines was created with 1,790 SNP markers. Of the 1,790 mapped SNP markers, 1,240 markers had been selectively chosen to target existing unanchored or un-oriented sequence scaffolds, thereby increasing the amount of anchored sequence to 97%. Conclusion: We have demonstrated how next generation sequencing was combined with high-throughput SNP detection assays to quickly discover large numbers of SNPs. Those SNPs were then used to create a high resolution genetic map that assisted in the assembly of scaffolds from the 8x whole genome shotgun sequences into pseudomolecules corresponding to chromosomes of the organism.},

@article{Hewezi:2010yb,
	Abstract = {Cyst nematodes are sedentary plant parasites that cause dramatic cellular changes in the plant root to form feeding cells, socalled syncytia. 10A06 is a cyst nematode secretory protein that is most likely secreted as an effector into the developing syncytia during early plant parasitism. A homolog of the uncharacterized soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines), 10A06 gene was cloned from the sugar beet cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii), which is able to infect Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Constitutive expression of 10A06 in Arabidopsis affected plant morphology and increased susceptibility to H. schachtii as well as to other plant pathogens. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we identified Spermidine Synthase2 (SPDS2), a key enzyme involved in polyamine biosynthesis, as a specific 10A06 interactor. In support of this protein-protein interaction, transgenic plants expressing 10A06 exhibited elevated SPDS2 mRNA abundance, significantly higher spermidine content, and increased polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity. Furthermore, the SPDS2 promoter was strongly activated in the nematode-induced syncytia, and transgenic plants overexpressing SPDS2 showed enhanced plant susceptibility to H. schachtii. In addition, in planta expression of 10A06 or SPDS2 increased mRNA abundance of a set of antioxidant genes upon nematode infection. These data lend strong support to a model in which the cyst nematode effector 10A06 exerts its function through the interaction with SPDS2, thereby increasing spermidine content and subsequently PAO activity. Increasing PAO activity results in stimulating the induction of the cellular antioxidant machinery in syncytia. Furthermore, we observed an apparent disruption of salicylic acid defense signaling as a function of 10A06. Most likely, increased antioxidant protection and interruption of salicylic acid signaling are key aspects of 10A06 function in addition to other physiological and morphological changes caused by altered polyamines, which are potent plant signaling molecules.},

	Abstract = {'N6202' soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (Reg. No. GP-366, PI 658498) was cooperatively developed and released by the USDA-ARS and the North Carolina Agricultural Research Service in October 2009 as a mid-Maturity Group VI germplasm with high-protein seed, favorable yield potential, large seed size, and diverse pedigree. The unusual combination of high protein and favorable yield in this germplasm, plus its diverse genetic background, makes it a potentially desirable breeding stock for both specialty and commodity breeding programs. N6202 was developed through conventional breeding and is adapted to the southern United States. Average seed protein level was 457 9 kg(-1) (zero moisture basis), which was 33 g kg-1 greater (p < 0.05) than that of the control cultivar NC-Roy. Average yield of N6202 was more than 90% of NC-Roy over 65 environments. The 100-seed weight of N6202 (21.4 g) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of the largest-seeded control cultivar Dillon (15.2 9). Twenty-five percent of N6202's pedigree is derived from Japanese cultivar Fukuyataka. Fukuyataka is not known to be related to the genetic base of U.S. soybean. An additional 25% of N6202's pedigree traces to the Japanese cultivar Nakasennari, which appears in the pedigree of only one cultivar (its parent 'N6201'). Thus, the release of N6202 broadens the genetic range of materials adapted for soybean breeding in the United States. N6202 exhibits a moderate level of the bleeding hilum trait in some environments.},

To facilitate cloning of a major defoliating insect-resistance QTL on linkage group M of the soybean genetic map, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for PI 229358 was constructed and characterized. The HindIII BAC library contains 55,296 clones with an average insert size 131 kb. This library represents a 6-fold soybean haploid genome equivalents, allowing a 99.8% probability of recovering any specific sequence of interest in soybean. BAC filters were screened with a genomic DNA probe Sat_258sc2 obtained through genome walking from flanking sequences of a simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker, Sat_258, which links to the insect-resistance QTL. Thirteen BAC clones were identified positive for Sat_258sc2, and two of them were confirmed to carry Sat_258. The results suggest that this library is useful in positional cloning of the major insect-resistance QTL, and the approach presented here can be used to screen a BAC library for a SSR marker without requiring the creation of BAC pools.},

	Abstract = {Background: High throughput methods, such as high density oligonucleotide microarray measurements of mRNA levels, are popular and critical to genome scale analysis and systems biology. However understanding the results of these analyses and in particular understanding the very wide range of levels of transcriptional changes observed is still a significant challenge. Many researchers still use an arbitrary cut off such as two-fold in order to identify changes that may be biologically significant. We have used a very large-scale microarray experiment involving 72 biological replicates to analyze the response of soybean plants to infection by the pathogen Phytophthora sojae and to analyze transcriptional modulation as a result of genotypic variation. Results: With the unprecedented level of statistical sensitivity provided by the high degree of replication, we show unambiguously that almost the entire plant genome (97 to 99% of all detectable genes) undergoes transcriptional modulation in response to infection and genetic variation. The majority of the transcriptional differences are less than two-fold in magnitude. We show that low amplitude modulation of gene expression (less than two-fold changes) is highly statistically significant and consistent across biological replicates, even for modulations of less than 20%. Our results are consistent through two different normalization methods and two different statistical analysis procedures. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the entire plant genome undergoes transcriptional modulation in response to infection and genetic variation. The pervasive low-magnitude remodeling of the transcriptome may be an integral component of physiological adaptation in soybean, and in all eukaryotes.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, is a destructive pest of soybean. Damage to soybean by SCN was first reported from northeastern China in 1899 (1). SCN has been documented in Anhui, Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Neimenggu, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces in mainland China (1). These provinces are situated in the Heilongjiang and Songhuajing valleys in northeastern China and the eastern region of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in northern China and have cold to temperate climates. In June of 2008, cyst-forming nematodes were detected in two soybean-growing areas of Hangzhou and Xiaoshan in Zhejiang Province, in subtropical eastern China. The soybean plants at the Hangzhou site showed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, whereas no aboveground or root symptoms were observed on soybean plants at the Xiaoshan site, except for the presence of SCN females on the roots. The two populations had the same morphological and molecular characters. The cysts were lemon shaped with posterior protuberance, ambifenestrate, underbridge and bullae strongly developed, and lateral field of second-stage juveniles consisted of four incisures. The key morphometrics of cysts were fenestra length (41 to 52 mu m) and width (33 to 48 mu m), vulval silt (47 to 55 mu m), and underbridge length (79 to 94 mu m), all of which were coincident with that of SCN (2). Amplification of rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using primers TW81 (5'-GTT TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GC-3') and AB28 (5'-ATA TGC TTA AGT TCA GCG GGT-3') yielded a PCR fragment of approximately 1,030 bp. The digestion patterns of the PCR fragments of the ITS region with AluI, AvaI, CfoI, MvaI, and RsaI showed identical restriction profiles to H. glycines (3), and the sequences exhibited 100% similarity with those of H. glycines isolates, Accession No. AY667456 from GenBank. Morphological and molecular identification confirmed that the two populations of cyst-forming nematodes from Zhejiang are SCN. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SCN in Zhejiang, now the most southern location in mainland China with confirmed infestation of SCN. References: (1) Z. X. Liu et al. Int. J.

	Abstract = {The breakdown of brassicaceous plant material produces nematotoxic isothiocyanates (ITCs). However, after the incorporation of brassicaceous plant material into soil, many nematodes are likely to be exposed only to sublethal concentrations of these compounds. Although unknown, the effect of these low ITC concentrations on the behaviour of plant-parasitic nematodes could play a role in nematode suppression. To address this question, the behaviour of infective second-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne incognita was evaluated following in vitro exposure to sublethal concentrations of benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC). Behaviour was qualitatively and quantitatively affected. Overall nematode activity in treatment groups scored visually, and individual nematode movement frequencies, quantified by video assay, were each significantly reduced within 2 h of exposure to 0.01 mM BITC. All responses were dose dependent. Infectivity of BITC-treated J2 of M. incognita on soybean (Glycine max) was measured directly by root staining and gall rating, and indirectly by egg production. All experiments showed significantly reduced infectivity after treatment of J2 with 0.01 mM BITC. In addition, egg production was almost completely eliminated (<5% of control) by 0.03 mM BITC. The correlation between the effect of BITC concentrations on J2 activity and infectivity was positive, with decreased J2 activity and infectivity resulting in decreased egg production. BITC concentrations that do not cause mortality significantly affect the behaviour of M. incognita J2, indicating that sublethal concentrations contribute to the overall nematode suppression by brassicaceous green manures.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome, caused by Fusarium virguliforme, and the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, combined cause the highest yield losses in soybean. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of corn rotated annually with soybean on reducing severity of sudden death syndrome (SDS) and if such crop rotation is beneficial to soybean root health and thus improves disease management strategies. Experiments were conducted from 2003 to 2006 through two cycles of a corn-soybean rotation on two commercial fields in Indiana. With one exception, the rotation of soybean with corn did not provide yield benefits compared to monoculture of soybean. Severity of foliar and root symptoms of SIDS in rotation plots were never less than in soybean monoculture plots. At one location. soybean monoculture resulted in suppression of SIDS compared to the corn-soybean rotation, while H. glycines reproduced freely. At the other location, monoculture of soybean resulted in suppressiveness against H. glycines, while SDS was limited in all treatments. The data suggest that soil suppressiveness can independently impact the pathogens that are important in SDS development. Because H. glycines can increase SIDS symptoms, its suppression may also reduce severity of SDS. Current production systems consisting of yearly rotation of soybean with corn are highly vulnerable to the development of severe soil-borne disease complexes. The simple year-to-year rotation of corn and soybean is not considered sustainable. While monoculture of soybean resulted in some disease suppression in these trials, reliance on monoculture may be detrimental due to other environmental considerations beyond the scope of these trials. Including other crops may be beneficial in improving the sustainability of soybean and corn production systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is time-consuming and labourious to prepare three-dimensional pools for a deep coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of soybean (1.12 x 10(9) bp) in the absence of robotic facility. In the present study, we describe a novel manual pooling system for preparing three-dimensional pools of a soybean BAC library. This simple technique enables a single researcher to construct three-dimensional pools for a deep-coverage (12 haploid genome equivalents) BAC library of soybean in less than 2 months without any robotic manipulation. When the prepared three-dimensional pools were screened with 29 polymerase chain reaction-based markers, an average of 9.2 clones per marker were identified. These identified clones will be useful either in quantitative trait loci gene isolation or in synteny study between soybean and other legumes including Lotus japonicus. This efficient pooling system could be applied to any other BAC libraries without the need for robotic manipulation.},

Objectives of this study were to confirm and refine the locations and gene action associated with SCN resistance previously discovered in PI 437654, and to identify new QTLs that may have been missed because of low coverage with genetic markers used in previous studies. Using 205 F-7:9 RILs and 276 SSR and AFLP molecular markers covering 2,406.5 cM of 20 linkage groups (LGs), we confirmed and refined the locations of major SCN resistance QTLs on LG-A2, -B1, and -G previously identified in PI 437654 or other resistant sources. We found that these major QTLs have epistatic effects among them or with other loci for SCN resistance. We also detected some new QTLs with additive or epistatic effects for SCN resistance to different HG types (races) on all LGs except LGs-B2 and -D1b. The QTL on LG-G was associated with resistance to HG types 2.5.7, 1.2.5.7, 0, and 2.7 (races 1, 2, 3, and 5), and it contributed a large proportion of the additive effects. The QTL on LG-A2 was associated with resistance to HG types 2.5.7 and 0 (races 1 and 3). The QTL on LG-B1, associated with resistance to HG types 2.5.7, 0, 2.7 (races 1, 3, and 5), was the similar QTL found in PI 90763 and PI 404198B.

	Abstract = {The effects of tillage on Heterodera glycines, the most important yield-reducing pathogen of soybean in the U.S., were examined in a long-term tillage and crop sequence study initiated in 1975 on a mollisol at Purdue University. Population densities of H. glycines were monitored under corn-soybean rotation and soybean monoculture in 2003 and 2004. Tillage treatments included: (A) fall moldboard plow + spring secondary tillage; (B) fall chisel plow + spring secondary tillage; (C) ridge tillage; and (D) no-tillage. In both years in the rotational plots, final population densities of H. glycines were proportional to tillage intensity. Under both soybean and corn rotation crops, highest population densities were observed with plowing + secondary tillage and lowest population densities were detected under no-tillage. In 2004, population densities in monoculture soybean soil declined with depth intervals in layers of 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30-cm depth under no-till, but not in plowed plots. Multiple regression analysis determined that the stratification of nematode population densities was strongly correlated to penetrometer resistance and potassium concentration of the soil. Tillage seemed to affect population densities of H. glycines by modification of the soil physical parameters in corn-soybean rotation plots. Reducing tillage intensity was beneficial in reducing population densities of H. glycines in rotational soils. Thus, the choice of tillage system can reduce the risk for damage by this widely distributed pathogen. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Hirsutella rhossiliensis OWVT-1 has substantial potential as a biocontrol agent against plant-parasitic nematodes. Serine proteases have emerged as a potentially useful factor in the nematode-fungus interactions. When grown in liquid culture with the nematode Panagrellus redivivus as the sole nitrogen source, an extracellular alkaline protease (Hasp) was produced by the OWVT-1. The purified Hasp killed the juveniles of the soybean-cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) and degraded proteins of the nematode cuticle. The molecular mass of Hasp was estimated to be 33 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were pH 9 and 75 degrees C. The amino acid sequence obtained by the N-terminal sequence analysis was applied for the primer design to isolate the Hasp cDNA gene, which consists of 1170 bp open reading frame. Analysis of the cDNA and corresponding genomic sequence revealed that Hasp included four exons (279, 186, 513, and 192 bp) divided by three introns (65, 99, and 93 bp). Southern blotting showed that Hasp was a single-copy gene in the genome. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to other serine proteases of endoparasitic and egg-parasitic fungi of nematodes and of entomopathogenic fungi but was less similar to the serine proteases of nematode-trapping fungi. In a phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of serine proteases, the serine protease of H. rhossiliensis OWVT-1 clustered with the serine proteases of parasites of nematode eggs rather than with those of the trapping fungi. 2009 Elsevier GmbH.},

	Abstract = {Protease inhibitors (PIs) are small ubiquitous proteins with a variety of biological functions in plants, including protein stabilization, modulation of apoptosis and defense against pathogens. Kunitz-like inhibitors (PKPIs) and proteinase inhibitors 1 (PI-1) are abundant in storage organs of potato plants and are up-regulated in other tissues in response to biotic and abiotic stress. However, little information is available on genotype-dependent regulation of individual PKPI group- and PI-1 genes. We isolated, sequenced and characterized four novel full-length PI-1 cDNAs (PPI3A2, PPI3A4, PPI2C4 and PPI2C1A) from Solarium tuberosum cv. Desiree. Specific primers were developed for PI-1 genes PPI3A2, PPI3B2 and PPI2C4 and the three PKPI homology groups A, B and C. Their expression profiles were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in comparison with transcripts of the PI-1, Pin2 and PR1 gene families in various tissues, after wounding and Globodera rostochiensis infection of nematode-resistant genotypes P40 and LB7/4/c-I-7, and susceptible cv. Desiree. Individual PI-1 genes and PKPI homology groups were expressed in a tissue- and genotype-dependent manner after wounding and nematode infection. The differences in PI expression patterns were related to the intensity, type of inhibitors produced, and the kinetics of induction. Therefore, different genotype-environment combinations produce different sets of PI transcripts. Potato plants reacted to G. rostochiensis infection by modulating PKPI, PI-1 and Pin2, but not PR1 gene expression, suggesting that the jasmonic acid but not the salicylic acid defense signaling pathway is activated. PI expression profiles were not correlated with the resistance status of the potato genotype infected with G. rostochiensis. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana is a host for the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. Juvenile nematodes invade the roots and induce the development of a syncytium, which functions as a feeding site for the nematode. Here, we report on the transcriptome of syncytia induced in the roots of Arabidopsis. Microaspiration was employed to harvest pure syncytium material, which was then used to prepare RNA for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips. Initial data analysis showed that the gene expression in syncytia at 5 and 15 days post-infection did not differ greatly, and so both time points were compared together with control roots. Out of a total of 21 138 genes, 18.4% (3893) had a higher expression level and 15.8% (3338) had a lower expression level in syncytia, as compared with control roots, using a multiple-testing corrected false discovery rate of below 5%. A gene ontology (GO) analysis of up- and downregulated genes showed that categories related to high metabolic activity were preferentially upregulated. A principal component analysis was applied to compare the transcriptome of syncytia with the transcriptome of different Arabidopsis organs (obtained by the AtGenExpress project), and with specific root tissues. This analysis revealed that syncytia are transcriptionally clearly different from roots (and all other organs), as well as from other root tissues.},

	Abstract = {Cyst nematodes are highly evolved sedentary plant endoparasites that use parasitism proteins injected through the stylet into host tissues to successfully parasitize plants. These secretory proteins likely are essential for parasitism as they are involved in a variety of parasitic events leading to the establishment of specialized feeding cells required by the nematode to obtain nourishment. With the advent of RNA interference (RNAi) technology and the demonstration of host-induced gene silencing in parasites, a new strategy to control pests and pathogens has become available, particularly in root-knot nematodes. Plant host-induced silencing of cyst nematode genes so far has had only limited success but similarly should disrupt the parasitic cycle and render the host plant resistant. Additional in planta RNAi data for cyst nematodes are being provided by targeting four parasitism genes through host-induced RNAi gene silencing in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a host for the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. Here it is reported that mRNA abundances of targeted nematode genes were specifically reduced in nematodes feeding on plants expressing corresponding RNAi constructs. Furthermore, this host-induced RNAi of all four nematode parasitism genes led to a reduction in the number of mature nematode females. Although no complete resistance was observed, the reduction of developing females ranged from 23% to 64% in different RNAi lines. These observations demonstrate the relevance of the targeted parasitism genes during the nematode life cycle and, potentially more importantly, suggest that a viable level of resistance in crop plants may be accomplished in the future using this technology against cyst nematodes.},

The differential host reaction, using polycystic inoculum, allowed only the identification of the prevalent race or the race with highest population within each sample. In the sample of Cruz Alta only race 3 was detected and in the sample of Porto Mendes only race 6. However, it was not possible to identify the prevalent race of H. glycines in the sample of Novo Horizonte. Nevertheless, when the genetic variability of SCN was studied within each population, using inoculum from populations built up from single cysts, races 6 and 3 were detected in the sample of Cruz Alta, races 6, 5 and 2 from Porto Mendes and races 10 and 6 from Novo Horizonte.

Further yield decline can occur due to infestations by soybean cyst nematodes (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) that are often present in greater numbers in high-pH soils. An observational study was conducted from 2001 to 2005 in Iowa to examine the relationships among: pH; CaCO3 equivalent (CCE); alkalinity stress index (ASI), which combines pH and CCE in one value; SCN; and soybean grain yield of SCN-resistant and susceptible cultivars. The stud), was conducted within 23 fields that had marked variability in soybean growth. Remote sensing of soybean canopies was used to help identify 10 to 16 sampling areas within each field. Soil samples were analyzed for pH, CCE, and SCN population densities. Grain samples were used to calculate relative yields (RY) in each field. The RY declined with increases in pH, CCE, ASI, and SCN densities more for SCN-susceptible than resistant cultivars. The ASI explained a greater percentage of variability of soybean yield than did pH or CCE alone. The ASI explained 18 and 45% of yield variability of SCN-resistant and susceptible cultivars, respectively, while pH explained 13% (SCN-resistant) and 36% (SCN-susceptibic) and CCE explained 15% (SCN-resistant) and 32% (SCN-susceptible) of yield variability, respectively. The SCN population densities were more strongly related to soil pH than to CCE. The ASI explained the same proportion of variability in SCN population densities as did soil pH.},

	Abstract = {Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes secrete cell wall modifying proteins during their invasion of host plants. In this study, we used a monoclonal antibody to immunopurify and to sequence the N terminus of the most abundant cellulases in stylet secretions of preparasitic juveniles of Globodera rostochiensis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence perfectly matched the sequence of an expressed sequence tag of two nearly identical genes, named Gr-eng3 and Gr-eng4, which show relatively low similarity with the previously identified Gr-eng1 and Gr-eng2 (i.e., 62% similarity and 42% identity). The recombinantly produced proteins from Gr-eng3 and Gr-eng4 demonstrated specific activity on carboxymethylcellulose, indicating that these genes encode active cellulases. To date, the cellulases in cyst nematodes are comprised of three possible domain structure variants with different types of ancillary domains at the C terminus of the glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) domain. We used Bayesian inference to show that the phylogeny of the GHF5 domain based on currently available data suggest that the extant nematode cellulases arose through reshuffling of the GHF5 domain with different types of ancillary domains as relatively independent units. Knocking-down Gr-eng3 and Gr-eng4 using RNA interference resulted in a reduction of nematode infectivity by 57%. Our observations show that the reduced infectivity of the nematodes can be attributed to poor penetration of the host's root system at the onset of parasitism.},

Results are analyzed with respect to similarly detailed reconstructions of Rhabditida outgroup nematodes, Acrobeles complexus (Cephalobomorpha) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Rhabditomorpha). Homologies identified in A. avenae demonstrate the general conservation of the anterior sensory system between freeliving nematodes and the largely plant parasitic Tylenchomorpha. A higher degree of similarity is shown between A. avenae and A. complexus, with common features including: the presence of a second, internal outer labial dendrite (OL1); a second cephalic dendrite in the female (CEP2/CEM); an accessory process loop of inner labial dendrite 1; and terminus morphology and epidermal associations of internal sensory receptors BAG and URX. Unique to A. avenae is a pair of peripheral, lateral neurons of unknown homology but with axial positions and intercellular relationships nearly identical to the "posterior branches" of URX in A. complexus.

In the last decade genetically modified soybean tolerant to glyphosate has become widely planted and postemergence application of glyphosate has increased exponentially. Genetically modified crops may affect nontarget microorganisms, either directly or indirectly as in the case of glyphosate application to tolerant crops. Glyphosate translocates to soybean roots where it might affect metabolic sinks such as syncytia produced by Heterodera glycines. In 2002-2004 glyphosate tolerant soybean DSR 320 susceptible to H. glycines and DSR 327 resistant to H. glycines were grown in three different fields and either sprayed with glyphosate at the recommended rate and time of application or not sprayed. Nematode reproduction and soybean yield were determined. In all three years, Pf and Pf/Pi were significantly greater on DSR 320 when compared with DSR 327. In 2004, when Pi exceeded the damage threshold, there was a cultivar x glyphosate interaction for Pf on DSR 320 with greater numbers of eggs recovered from glyphosate treated DSR 320. In 2002 and 2003 Pi was below the damage threshold and no differences in yield occurred between the resistant and susceptible cultivars. However, in 2003 a significant cultivar x glyphosate interaction was observed for yield of DSR 320. In 2004 a significant difference in yield between DSR 320 and DSR 327 was observed. Glyphosate application affected Pf of H. glycines eggs in 2004, the only year Pi exceeded the damage threshold. However, the increase Pf did not translate into crop loss.},

In combination with phenotypic identification in earlier investigations, rhg1-I4 was highly associated with SCN resistance, and screened out 88.2% of the resistant genotypes and 100% of the susceptible genotypes. Alleles of 288 and 294 bp presented in the SCN-resistant germplasm, and alleles of 269 and 272 bp presented in the SCN-susceptible germplasm. In addition, rhg1-I4 is also effective to distinguish the susceptible cultivar Lee and the resistant line PI88788 that have same amplification pattern with the SSR marker Satt309.

Here, we report the development and validation of a high-throughput EST-derived SNP assay for cowpea, its application in consensus map building, and determination of synteny to reference genomes. SNP mining from 183,118 ESTs sequenced from 17 cDNA libraries yielded approximate to 10,000 high-confidence SNPs from which an Illumina 1,536-SNP GoldenGate genotyping array was developed and applied to 741 recombinant inbred lines from six mapping populations. Approximately 90% of the SNPs were technically successful, providing 1,375 dependable markers. Of these, 928 were incorporated into a consensus genetic map spanning 680 cM with 11 linkage groups and an average marker distance of 0.73 cM. Comparison of this cowpea genetic map to reference legumes, soybean (Glycine max) and Medicago truncatula, revealed extensive macrosynteny encompassing 85 and 82%, respectively, of the cowpea map. Regions of soybean genome duplication were evident relative to the simpler diploid cowpea. Comparison with Arabidopsis revealed extensive genomic rearrangement with some conserved microsynteny. These results support evolutionary closeness between cowpea and soybean and identify regions for synteny-based functional genomics studies in legumes.},

	Abstract = {A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the influence of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) -susceptible and -resistant plant combinations on SCN population densities and plant growth. Purple deadnettle, annual ryegrass, SCN-resistant and -susceptible soybean were planted in pots alone or in combination at one plant pot(-1). Annual ryegrass and purple deadnettle reduced soybean growth. Pots with SCN-resistant plants had lower numbers of SCN cysts and eggs than pots with SCN-susceptible plants. However, an SCN-susceptible species grown with any of the SCN-resistant plants resulted in higher cyst counts than pots with only SCN-resistant plants. From an SCN management standpoint, this research suggests that there may be no incentive to using annual ryegrass as a cover crop over planting other SCN-resistant crops to reduce SCN population density.},

	Abstract = {Sedentary endoparasitic nematodes cause extensive damage to a large number of ornamental plants and food crops, with estimated economical losses over 100 billion US$ worldwide. Various efforts have put forth in order to minimize nematode damage, which typically involve the use of nematicides that have high cost and enhanced toxicity to humans and the environment. Additionally, different strategies have been applied in order to develop genetically modified plants with improved nematode resistance. Among the strategies are anti-invasion and migration, feeding-cell attenuation, and anti-nematode feeding. In the present study, we focus on anti-nematode feeding, which involves the evaluation and potential use of the cysteine proteinase (CPs) propeptide as a control alternative. The cysteine proteinase prodomain, isolated from Heterodera glycines (HGCP prodomain), is a natural inhibitory peptide used to transform soybean cotyledons using Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Genetically modified soybean roots expressing the propeptide were detected by Western blot and expression levels were measured by ELISA (around 0.3%). The transgenic roots expressing the propeptide were inoculated with a thousand H. glycines at the second juvenile stage, and a remarkable reduction in the number of females and eggs was observed. A reduction of female length and diameter was also observed after 35 days post-inoculation. Furthermore, the H. glycines mature protein was detected in females fed on soybean transformed root expressing or not expressing the propeptide. The data presented here indicate that the HGCP propeptide can reduce soybean cyst nematode infection and this strategy could be applied in the near future to generate resistant crop cultivars.},

	Abstract = {Plant CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) peptides have diverse roles in plant growth and development. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of five new CLE genes from the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis. Unlike typical plant CLE peptides that contain a single CLE motif, four of the five Gr-CLE genes encode CLE proteins with multiple CLE motifs. These Gr-CLE genes were found to be specifically expressed within the dorsal esophageal gland cell of nematode parasitic stages, suggesting a role for their encoded proteins in plant parasitism. Overexpression phenotypes of Gr-CLE genes in Arabidopsis mimicked those of plant CLE genes, and Gr-CLE proteins could rescue the Arabidopsis clv3-2 mutant phenotype when expressed within meristems. A short root phenotype was observed when synthetic GrCLE peptides were exogenously applied to roots of Arabidopsis or potato similar to the overexpression of Gr-CLE genes in Arabidopsis and potato hairy roots. These results reveal that G. rostochiensis CLE proteins with either single or multiple CLE motifs function similarly to plant CLE proteins and that CLE signaling components are conserved in both Arabidopsis and potato roots. Furthermore, our results provide evidence to suggest that the evolution of multiple CLE motifs may be an important mechanism for generating functional diversity in nematode CLE proteins to facilitate parasitism.},

	Abstract = {The parasitism of soybean cyst nematode. Heterodera glycines, by the fungi Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Hirsutella minnesotensis and their biocontrol effectiveness against the nematode were investigated in four soils with various pH, texture, and organic matter. Fungal parasitism was assayed in the soils in 25 mL vials. As expected, percentage of H. glycines second-stage juveniles (J2) parasitized by either fungus increased with increasing number of fungus-colonized J2 initially added into the soils. Parasitism of J2 by the fungi was negatively related with soil pH. Both positive and negative relationships with fungal parasitism were observed for soil sandiness and organic matter. In greenhouse study, both fungi at 0.2-0.8 g fresh mycelium of liquid culture per 0.3 L pot and 1% corn-grits culture effectively reduced nematode population density, The relationship between biocontrol effectiveness and the soil factors depended on fungal species and inoculation levels. In general, percentage reduction of egg population density in the soil was negatively correlated with soil pH and positively correlated with sandiness. There was not or weak correlation between egg reduction and organic matter. The percentage of J2 parasitized by the fungi 2 months after planting did not correlate with the soil factors. Plant growth was better in the two soils with intermediate pH and sand than the soil with high pH and low sand or with low pH and high sand. It appeared that soil pH and/or texture are important in influencing biocontrol effectiveness, but further studies are needed to determine the effect of individual factors because they are correlated.},

The results indicated that G. max population, consisted of cultivated soybean mini-core collection and modern cultivars, had a higher LD levels (R2 value is 0.216) than G. soja population. Since 100% of pairwise loci within a gene and 16.6% of pairwise loci between genes were significant in G. max population, two specific LD regions were formed for each gene. A total of 46 haplotypes were detected in 363 soybean germplasm. The population of G. soja had less number of haplotypes and higher haplotype diversity than the population of G. max. Among the 31 population-specific haplotypes, 15 haplotypes were specific for G. soja population. In addition, the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (Hap_10 and Hap_11) in G. soja population was obviously decreased in G. max population, which might indicate that some new haplotypes were formed and some old haplotypes were lost during the G. max domesticated from G. soja.},

	Abstract = {Previous research showed that the hatch of second-stage juveniles (J2) from white females (cysts) was significantly different from that of J2 from brown cysts, which indicated that there were differences in diapause between J2 in white and brown cysts. In order to find out the relationships between some biochemical characters and diapause of Heterodera glycines, hatch rate and biochemical indices (total carbohydrate, glycogen, trehalose, glycerol and protein, and activity of esterase and trehalase) in white and brown cysts of H. glycines race 4 were studied. The results suggested that hatch rate of J2 from brown cysts was significantly lower than that of J2 from white cysts. The glycogen and protein content and the activity of esterase in brown cysts were lower than in white cysts, whereas the total carbohydrate and trehalose content and the activity of trehalase in brown cysts were higher than in white cysts. Therefore, diapause in unhatched J2 in brown cysts was more extensive than that in J2 in white cysts, and active mutual transformation between trehalose and glycogen existed in brown cysts. SDS-PAGE patterns showed that there are 15 and 10 protein bands in white and brown cysts, respectively, and proteins of molecular masses 116.6, 79.1, 68.2, 64.3 and 60.5 kDa existed in white cysts, but were not present in brown cysts. There were three and six bands in patterns of esterase isoenzymes in white and brown cysts, respectively; EST0.63, EST0.75, EST0.81 of esterase isoenzymes occurred in brown cysts but not in white cysts. The result suggested that protein content declined and activity of esterase isoenzyme was enhanced during the transition from white to brown cyst. The low hatch rate of J2 from eggs in brown cysts might be related to these indices.},

	Abstract = {Host-mediated (hm) expression of parasite genes as tandem inverted repeats was investigated as a means to abrogate the formation of mature Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode) female cysts during its infection of Glycine max (soybean). A Gateway(A (R))-compatible hm plant transformation system was developed specifically for these experiments in G. max. Three steps then were taken to identify H. glycines candidate genes. First, a pool of 150 highly conserved H. glycines homologs of genes having lethal mutant phenotypes or phenocopies from the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were identified. Second, annotation of those 150 genes on the Affymetrix(A (R)) soybean GeneChip(A (R)) allowed for the identification of a subset of 131 genes whose expression could be monitored during the parasitic phase of the H. glycines life cycle. Third, a microarray analyses identified a core set of 32 genes with induced expression (> 2.0-fold, log base 2) during the parasitic stages of infection. H. glycines homologs of small ribosomal protein 3a and 4 (Hg-rps-3a [accession number CB379877] and Hg-rps-4 [accession number CB278739]), synaptobrevin (Hg-snb-1 [accession number BF014436]) and a spliceosomal SR protein (Hg-spk-1 [accession number BI451523.1]) were tested for functionality in hm expression studies. Effects on H. glycines development were observed 8 days after infection. Experiments demonstrated that 81-93% fewer females developed on transgenic roots containing the genes engineered as tandem inverted repeats. The effect resembles RNA interference. The methodology has been used here as an alternative approach to engineer resistance to H. glycines.},

	Abstract = {The syncytium is a nurse cell formed within the roots of Glycine max by the plant parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines. Its development and maintenance are essential for nematode survival. The syncytium appears to undergo two developmental phases during its maturation into a functional nurse cell. The first phase is a parasitism phase where the nematode establishes the molecular circuitry that during the second phase ensures a compatible interaction with the plant cell. The cytological features of syncytia undergoing susceptible or resistant reactions appear the same during the parasitism phase. Depending on the outcome of any defense response, the second phase is a period of syncytium maintenance (susceptible reaction) or failure (resistant reaction). In the analyses presented here, the localized gene expression occurring at the syncytium during the resistant reaction was studied. This was accomplished by isolating syncytial cells from Glycine max genotype Peking (PI 548402) by laser capture microdissection. Microarray analyses using the Affymetrix(A (R)) soybean GeneChip(A (R)) directly compared Peking syncytia undergoing a resistant reaction to those undergoing a susceptible reaction during the parasitism phase of the resistant reaction. Those analyses revealed lipoxygenase-9 and lipoxygenase-4 as the most highly induced genes in the resistant reaction. The analysis also identified induced levels of components of the phenylpropanoid pathway. These genes included phenylalanine ammonia lyase, chalcone isomerase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. The presence of induced levels of these genes implies the importance of jasmonic acid and phenylpropanoid signaling pathways locally at the site of the syncytium during the resistance phase of the resistant reaction. The analysis also identified highly induced levels of four S-adenosylmethionine synthetase genes, the EARLY-RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 2 gene and the 14-3-3 gene known as GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR 2. Subsequent analyses studied microdissected syncytial cells at 3, 6 and 9 days post infection (dpi) during the course of the resistant reaction, resulting in the identification of signature gene expression profiles at each time point in a single G. max genotype, Peking.},

	Abstract = {Background: A single Glycine max (soybean) genotype (Peking) reacts differently to two different populations of Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode) within the first twelve hours of infection during resistant (R) and susceptible (S) reactions. This suggested that H. glycines has population-specific gene expression signatures. A microarray analysis of 7539 probe sets representing 7431 transcripts on the Affymetrix (R) soybean GeneChip (R) were used to identify population-specific gene expression signatures in pre-infective second stage larva (pi-L2) prior to their infection of Peking. Other analyses focused on the infective L2 at 12hours post infection (i-L2(12h)), and the infective sedentary stages at 3days post infection (i-L2(3d)) and 8days post infection (i-L2/L3(8d)). Results: Differential expression and false discovery rate (FDR) analyses comparing populations of pi-L2 (i.e., incompatible population, NL1-RHg to compatible population, TN8) identified 71 genes that were induced in NL1-RHg as compared to TN8. These genes included putative gland protein G23G12, putative esophageal gland protein Hgg-20 and arginine kinase. The comparative analysis of pi-L2 identified 44 genes that were suppressed in NL1-RHg as compared to TN8. These genes included a different Hgg-20 gene, an EXPB1 protein and a cuticular collagen. By 12 h, there were 7 induced genes and 0 suppressed genes in NL1-RHg. By 3d, there were 9 induced and 10 suppressed genes in NL1-RHg. Substantial changes in gene expression became evident subsequently. At 8d there were 13 induced genes in NL1-RHg. This included putative gland protein G20E03, ubiquitin extension protein, putative gland protein G30C02 and beta-1,4 endoglucanase. However, 1668 genes were found to be suppressed in NL1-RHg. These genes included steroid alpha reductase, serine proteinase and a collagen protein. Conclusion: These analyses identify a genetic expression signature for these two populations both prior to and subsequently as they undergo an R or S reaction. The identification of genes like steroid alpha reductase and serine proteinase that are involved in feeding and nutritional uptake as being highly suppressed during the R response at 8d may indicate genes that the plant is targeting. The analyses also identified numerous putative parasitism genes that are differentially expressed. The 1668 genes that are suppressed in NL1-RHg, and hence induced in TN8 may represent genes that are important during the parasitic stages of H. glycines development. The potential for different arrays of putative parasitism genes to be expressed in different nematode populations may indicate how H. glycines evolve mechanisms to overcome resistance.},

A small family of genes is present in both species and the Bursaphelenchus genes are most similar to expansins and expansin-like proteins from the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis and root-knot nematodes. Molecular modelling suggests that the genes could encode a protein with a structure similar to that of functionally characterised expansins. Expression analysis showed that the Bursaphelenchus expansin-like genes are expressed solely in the pharyngeal gland cells, implying a role in the host-parasite interaction, most likely in assisting migration through the plant. Some G. rostochiensis and root-knot nematode expansins are composed of a carbohydrate-binding domain coupled to an expansin domain but no carbohydrate binding domain is present on any of the Bursaphelenchus sequences. We suggest a model for evolution of the expansin gene family within the plant-parasitic nematodes of the Tylenchida and Aphelenchida.},

	Abstract = {Background: The fungivorus nematode, Aphelenchus avenae is widespread in soil and is found in association with decaying plant material. This nematode is also found in association with plants but its ability to cause plant disease remains largely undetermined. The taxonomic position and intermediate lifestyle of A. avenae make it an important model for studying the evolution of plant parasitism within the Nematoda. In addition, the exceptional capacity of this nematode to survive desiccation makes it an important system for study of anhydrobiosis. Expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis may therefore be useful in providing an initial insight into the poorly understood genetic background of A. avenae. Results: We present the generation, analysis and annotation of over 5,000 ESTs from a mixed-stage A. avenae cDNA library. Clustering of 5,076 high-quality ESTs resulted in a set of 2,700 non-redundant sequences comprising 695 contigs and 2,005 singletons. Comparative analyses indicated that 1,567 (58.0%) of the cluster sequences had homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, 1,750 (64.8%) in other nematodes, 1,321(48.9%) in organisms other than nematodes, and 862 (31.9%) had no significant match to any sequence in current protein or nucleotide databases. In addition, 1,100 (40.7%) of the sequences were functionally classified using Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Similarity searches of the cluster sequences identified a set of genes with significant homology to genes encoding enzymes that degrade plant or fungal cell walls. The full length sequences of two genes encoding glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) cellulases and two pectate lyase genes encoding polysaccharide lyase family 3 (PL3) proteins were identified and characterized. Conclusion: We have described at least 2,214 putative genes from A. avenae and identified a set of genes encoding a range of cell-wall-degrading enzymes. This EST dataset represents a starting point for studies in a number of different fundamental and applied areas. The presence of genes encoding a battery of cell-wall-degrading enzymes in A. avenae and their similarities with genes from other plant parasitic nematodes suggest that this nematode can act not only as a fungal feeder but also a plant parasite. Further studies on genes encoding cell-wall-degrading enzymes in A. avenae will accelerate our understanding of the complex evolutionary histories of plant parasitism and the use of genes obtained by horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes.},

	Abstract = {In soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) combining resistance to cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines I.) with high seed yieldremains problematic. Molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) have not provided a solution. Sets of markers describing a collection of favorable alleles (linkats) may assist plant breeders seeking to combine both traits. The objective of this analysis was to identify linkats in genomic regions underlying seed yield and root SCN resistance QTL. Used were groups of cultivars selected from a single recombinant inbred (RIL) population derived from 'Essex' by 'Forrest' (ExF). The yield was measured at four locations. SCN resistance was determined in greenhouse assays. The mean seed yield was used to define 3 groups (each n = 30), high, medium and low. SCN resistance formed 2 groups (SCN resistant (n = 21) and SCN susceptible (n = 69)). Microsatellite markers (213) alleles were compared with seed yield and root SCN (Hetrodera glycines) resistance using mean analysis. The number, size and position of potential linkats were determined. Loci, genomic regions and linkats associated with seed yield were identified on linkage group (LG) K and with root resistance to SCN e on LG E, G, and D1b+W. A method to identify co-localized genomic regions is presented.},

	Abstract = {1. As herbivory often elicits systemic changes in plant traits, indirect interactions via induced plant responses may be a pervasive feature structuring herbivore communities. Although the importance of this phenomenon has been emphasised for herbivorous insects, it is unknown if and how induced responses contribute to the organisation of other major phytoparasitic taxa. 2. Survey and experimental field studies were used to investigate the role of plants in linking the dynamics of foliar-feeding insects and root-feeding nematodes on tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum. 3. Plant-mediated interactions between insects and nematodes could largely be differentiated by insect feeding guild, with positive insect-nematode interactions predominating with leaf-chewing insects (caterpillars) and negative interactions occurring with sap-feeding insects (aphids). For example, insect defoliation was positively correlated with the abundance of root-feeding nematodes, but aphids and nematodes were negatively correlated. Experimental field manipulations of foliar insect and nematode root herbivory also tended to support this outcome. 4. Overall, these results suggest that plants indirectly link the dynamics of divergent consumer taxa in spatially distinct ecosystems. This lends support to the growing perception that plants play a critical role in propagating indirect effects among a diverse assemblage of consumers.},

We have identified over 50 G. pallida effectors from this dataset using bioinformatics analysis, by screening clones in order to identify secreted proteins up-regulated after the onset of parasitism and using in situ hybridization to confirm the expression in pharyngeal gland cells. A substantial gene family encoding G. pallida SPRYSEC proteins has been identified. The expression of these genes is restricted to the dorsal pharyngeal gland cell. Different members of the SPRYSEC family of proteins from G. pallida show different subcellular localization patterns in plants, with some localized to the cytoplasm and others to the nucleus and nucleolus. Differences in subcellular localization may reflect diverse functional roles for each individual protein or, more likely, variety in the compartmentalization of plant proteins targeted by the nematode. Our data are therefore consistent with the suggestion that the SPRYSEC proteins suppress host defences, as suggested previously, and that they achieve this through interaction with a range of host targets.},

	Abstract = {Multigeneic QTL present significant problems to analysis. Resistance to soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) sudden death syndrome (SDS) caused by Fusarium virguliforme was partly underlain by QRfs2 that was clustered with, or pleiotropic to, the multigeneic rhg1 locus providing resistance to soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines). A group of five genes were found between the two markers that delimited the Rfs2/rhg1 locus. One of the five genes was predicted to encode an unusual diphenol oxidase (laccase; EC 1.10.3.2). The aim of this study was to characterize this member of the soybean laccase gene-family and explore its involvement in SDS resistance. A genomic clone and a full length cDNA was isolated from resistant cultivar 'Forrest' that were different among susceptible cultivars 'Asgrow 3244' and 'Williams 82' at four residues R/H168, I/M271, R/H330, E/K470. Additional differences were found in six of the seven introns and the promoter region. Transcript abundance (TA) among genotypes that varied for resistance to SDS or SCN did not differ significantly. Therefore the protein activity was inferred to underlie resistance. Protein expressed in yeast pYES2/NTB had weak enzyme activity with common substrates but good activity with root phenolics. The Forrest isoform may underlie both QRfs2 and rhg1.},

	Abstract = {Evaluation of soybean germplasm for resistance to brown stem rot (BSR) is typically based on symptom severity. However, this approach may not reflect the level of colonization of soybean by the casual agent, Phialophora gregata. A potentially more accurate method to characterize resistance to BSR is to estimate pathogen quantity. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate soybean accessions for resistance to BSR based on the quantity of pathogen in stems. Plants were collected from experiments in field and controlled environments, and CFU and pathogen DNA quantity were determined using dilution plating techniques and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. In the field, the BSR-susceptible cultivars Corsoy 79 and Century 84 expressed greater than 73% foliar and stem symptom severity and had the highest pathogen population density, with a range from logo 4.3 to 4.7 CFU per gram of stem tissue. The resistant cultivar Bell expressed less than 10% foliar symptom severity, but had a pathogen population density that was not statistically different from the susceptible accessions. CFU measured in Dwight and L84-5873 were consistently lower than CFU in susceptible accessions and several resistant accessions. The amount of pathogen DNA differed among accessions in controlled environments. For example, Corsoy 79 and Century 84 had the highest pathogen DNA quantity, ranging from log(10) 6.19 to 6.65 copies, whereas the resistant cultivars Bell, Dwight, and L845873 had significantly lower DNA quantities, ranging from logo 2.04 to 2.91 copies. PI 437833 and IA2008R expressed low symptom severity but contained high DNA quantities. Pella 86, a highly symptomatic cultivar, had fewer CFU and lower DNA quantity in comparison to two other highly symptomatic cultivars and some cultivars with low symptom severity. These results suggest that some accessions express resistance to both pathogen colonization and symptom development, while others are resistant to symptom development but not to pathogen colonization. Results also indicate that resistant and susceptible accessions can be distinguished based on DNA quantity in controlled environments. In the field, differences between the pathogen population in resistant and susceptible cultivars were less distinct, possibly due to when plants were assayed.},

	Abstract = {Few resistance loci to soybean rust (SBR), caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi Syd., have been genetically mapped and linked to molecular markers that can be used for marker assisted selection. New technologies are available for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping that can be used to rapidly map traits controlled by single loci such as resistance to SBR. Our objective was to demonstrate that the high-throughput SNP genotyping method known as the GoldenGate assay can be used to perform bulked segregant analysis (BSA) to find candidate regions to facilitate efficient mapping of a dominant resistant locus to SBR designated Rpp3. We used a 1536 SNP GoldenGate assay to perform BSA followed by simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping in an F-2 population segregating for SBR resistance conditioned by Rpp3. A 13-cM region on linkage group C2 was the only candidate region identified with BSA. Subsequent F-2 mapping placed Rpp3 between SSR markers BARC_Satt460 and BARC.Sat_263 on linkage group C2 which is the same region identified by BSA. These results suggest that the GoldenGate assay was successful at implementing BSA, making it a powerful tool to quickly map qualitative traits since the GoldenGate assay is capable of screening 1536 SNPs on 192 DNA samples in three days.},

	Abstract = {The wheat. leaf-rust resistance gene Lr21 was first identified in air Iranian accession of goatgrass, Aegilops tauschii Coss., the D-genome donor of hexaploid bread wheat, and was introgressed into modern wheat cultivars by breeding. To elucidate tire origin of the gene, we analyzed sequences of Lr21 and lr21 alleles from 24 wheat cultivars and 25 accessions of Ae. tauschii collected along the Caspian Sea in Iran and Azerbaijan. Three basic nonfunctional lr21 haplotypes, H1, H2, and H3, were identified. Lr21 was found to be a chimera of H1 and H2, which were found only in wheat. We attempted to reconstitute a functional Lr21 allele by crossing the cultivars Fielder (H1) and Wichita (H2). Rust inoculation of 5876 F-2 progeny revealed a single resistant plant that proved to carry the H1H2 haplotype, a result attributed to intragenic recombination. These findings reflect. how plants balance the penalty and the necessity of a resistance gene and suggest that plants can reuse "dead" alleles to generate new disease-resistance specificity, leading to a "death-recycle" model of plant-resistance gene evolution at simple loci. We suggest that selection pressure in crop-weed complexes contributes to this process.},

	Abstract = {Plant-parasitic nematodes have developed an arsenal of enzymes to degrade the rigid plant cell wall. In this article, we report the presence of a putative endoxylanase in the migratory endoparasitic nematode Radopholus similis. This enzyme is thought to facilitate the migration of the nematode, as it breaks down xylan, the major component of hemicellulose. The corresponding gene (Rs-xyl1) was cloned and the sequence revealed three small introns. Interestingly, the position of all three introns was conserved in a putative endoxylanase from Meloidogyne hapla, and the position of one intron was conserved in two endoxylanases from Meloidogyne incognita, which suggests a common ancestral gene. The spatial and temporal expression of the Rs-xyl1 gene was examined by in situ hybridization and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The putative protein consists of a signal peptide, a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The catalytic domain showed similarity to both glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) and GHF30 enzymes. Using Hidden Markov Model profiles and phylogenetic analysis, we were able to show that Rs-XYL1 and its closest homologues are not members of GHF5, as suggested previously, but rather form a subclass within GHF30. Silencing the putative endoxylanase by double-stranded RNA targeting of the CBM region resulted in an average decrease in infection of 60%, indicating that the gene is important for the nematode to complete its life cycle.},

	Abstract = {In this study, 4847 expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) from mixed stages of the migratory plant-parasitic nematode Ditylenchus africanus (peanut pod nematode) were investigated. It is the first molecular survey of a nematode which belongs to the family of the Anguinidae (order Rhabditida, superfamily Sphaerularioidea). The sequences were clustered into 2596 unigenes, of which 43% did not show any homology to known protein, nucleotide, nematode EST or plant-parasitic nematode genome sequences. Gene ontology mapping revealed that most putative proteins are involved in developmental and reproductive processes. In addition unigenes involved in oxidative stress as well as in anhydrobiosis, such as LEA (late embryogenesis abundant protein) and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase were identified. Other tags showed homology to genes previously described as being involved in parasitism (expansin, SEC-2, calreticulin, 14-3-3b and various allergen proteins). In situ hybridization revealed that the expression of a putative expansin and a venom allergen protein was restricted to the gland cell area of the nematode, being in agreement with their presumed role in parasitism. Furthermore, seven putative novel candidate parasitism genes were identified based on the prediction of a signal peptide in the corresponding protein sequence and homologous ESTs exclusively in parasitic nematodes. These genes are interesting for further research and functional characterization. Finally, 34 unigenes were retained as good target candidates for future RNAi experiments, because of their nematode specific nature and observed lethal phenotypes of Caenorhabditis elegans homologs.

@article{Gomez:2009jz,
	Abstract = {Background: Most vascular flowering plants have the capacity to form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The symbiosis develops in the roots where AM fungi colonize the root cortex and form arbuscules within the cortical cells. Arbuscules are enveloped in a novel plant membrane and their establishment requires the coordinated cellular activities of both symbiotic partners. The arbuscule-cortical cell interface is the primary functional interface of the symbiosis and is of central importance in nutrient exchange. To determine the molecular events the underlie arbuscule development and function, it is first necessary to identify genes that may play a role in this process. Toward this goal we used the Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Medicago Genome Array to document the M. truncatula transcript profiles associated with AM symbiosis, and then developed laser microdissection (LM) of M. truncatula root cortical cells to enable analyses of gene expression in individual cell types by RT-PCR. Results: This approach led to the identification of novel M. truncatula and G. intraradices genes expressed in colonized cortical cells and in arbuscules. Within the arbuscule, expression of genes associated with the urea cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and cellular autophagy was detected. Analysis of gene expression in the colonized cortical cell revealed up-regulation of a lysine motif (LysM)-receptor like kinase, members of the GRAS transcription factor family and a symbiosis-specific ammonium transporter that is a likely candidate for mediating ammonium transport in the AM symbiosis. Conclusion: Transcript profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Medicago Genome Array provided new insights into gene expression in M. truncatula roots during AM symbiosis and revealed the existence of several G. intraradices genes on the M. truncatula GeneChip (R). A laser microdissection protocol that incorporates low-melting temperature Steedman's wax, was developed to enable laser microdissection of M. truncatula root cortical cells. LM coupled with RT-PCR provided spatial gene expression information for both symbionts and expanded current information available for gene expression in cortical cells containing arbuscules.},

The role of soil pores that enable root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) second stage juveniles (J2) to escape rapid water flow in soil was demonstrated using columns filled with glass beads, sand or and isol that maintained a constant water flow. Under a constant flow flux of 36 cm h(-1). living J2, dead J2 or anion bromine tracer (Br-) was injected in the middle of the column and then drainage water equivalent to two pore volumes (PV) was collected The passive transport of the anion tracer in water flow could be explained by a convection dispersion equation. The dead J2 showed a pattern similar to that of Br-. However, the living J2 resisted movement in the water flow and remained in the column even at the highest water flow rate of 93.3 cm h(-1) in glass beads. The mobility of living J2 was affected by the filling materials: the number of J2 passing through the column was much lower in the andisol-filled column than in the other two columns but the total number of J2 in drainage water was 5% or less of the number injected for all columns. We suggest that J2 were affected not only by soil water flow but also by soil pore structure and have the ability of withstanding or avoiding movement in soil water flow. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mi-asp1 may represent a potential target for molecular intervention for the purposes of plant-parasitic nematode control. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica induces giant cells and feeds from them during its development and reproduction. To study the cellular processes underlying the formation of giant cells, laser microdissection was used to isolate the contents of early-stage giant cells 4 and 7 days post-infection (dpi) from tomato, and cDNA libraries from both stages were generated with 87 [250 expressed sequence tag (EST) clones] and 54 (309 EST clones) individual transcripts identified, respectively. These transcripts have roles in metabolism, stress response, protein synthesis, cell division and morphogenesis, transport, signal transduction, protein modification and fate, and regulation of cellular processes. The expression of 25 selected transcripts was studied further by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Among them, 13 showed continuous up-regulation in giant cells from 4 to 7 dpi. The expression of two transcripts was higher than in controls at 4 dpi and remained at the same level at 7 dpi; a further five transcripts were highly expressed only at 7 dpi. The Phi-1 protein gene, a cell cycle-related homologue in tobacco, was expressed 8.5 times more strongly in giant cells than in control cells at 4 dpi, but was reduced to 6.7 times at 7 dpi. Using in situ hybridization, the expression of the Phi-1 gene was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm of giant cells at 4 dpi, together with a pectinesterase U1 precursor gene. The identification of highly expressed transcripts in developing giant cells adds to the knowledge of the plant genes responsive to nematode infection, and may provide candidate genes for nematode control strategies.},

	Abstract = {Background: Cyst nematodes are devastating plant parasites that become sedentary within plant roots and induce the transformation of normal plant cells into elaborate feeding cells with the help of secreted effectors, the parasitism proteins. These proteins are the translation products of parasitism genes and are secreted molecular tools that allow cyst nematodes to infect plants. Results: We present here the expression patterns of all previously described parasitism genes of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, in all major life stages except the adult male. These insights were gained by analyzing our gene expression dataset from experiments using the Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array GeneChip, which contains probeset sequences for 6,860 genes derived from preparasitic and parasitic H. glycines life stages. Targeting the identification of additional H. glycines parasitism-associated genes, we isolated 633 genes encoding secretory proteins using algorithms to predict secretory signal peptides. Furthermore, because some of the known H. glycines parasitism proteins have strongest similarity to proteins of plants and microbes, we searched for predicted protein sequences that showed their highest similarities to plant or microbial proteins and identified 156 H. glycines genes, some of which also contained a signal peptide. Analyses of the expression profiles of these genes allowed the formulation of hypotheses about potential roles in parasitism. This is the first study combining sequence analyses of a substantial EST dataset with microarray expression data of all major life stages (except adult males) for the identification and characterization of putative parasitism-associated proteins in any parasitic nematode. Conclusion: We have established an expression atlas for all known H. glycines parasitism genes. Furthermore, in an effort to identify additional H. glycines genes with putative functions in parasitism, we have reduced the currently known 6,860 H. glycines genes to a pool of 788 most promising candidate genes (including known parasitism genes) and documented their expression profiles. Using our approach to pre-select genes likely involved in parasitism now allows detailed functional analyses in a manner not feasible for larger numbers of genes. The generation of the candidate pool described here is an important enabling advance because it will significantly facilitate the unraveling of fascinating plant-animal interactions and deliver knowledge that can be transferred to other pathogen-host systems. Ultimately, the exploration of true parasitism genes verified from the gene pool delineated here will identify weaknesses in the nematode life cycle that can be exploited by novel anti-nematode efforts.},

Greenhouse and microplot experiments were conducted with the runner type peanut genotypes C724-19-15, C724-19-25 and Georgia-02C with different levels of resistance to nematode and CBR to better understand the interactions between the two pathogens. In the greenhouse, inoculation of 500-3000 eggs per plant of M. arenaria did not affect the level of root rot induced by 1.0 to 5.0 microsclerotia of C. parasiticum per g soil. In microplots, the root rot ratings from Georgia-02C and C724-19-25 were higher in plots infested with M. arenaria (0.4-2.0 eggs per cm(3) soil) and C. parasiticum than in plots with C. parasiticum alone; however, M. arenaria did not increase the root rot ratings on the nematode resistant C724-19-15. This was inconsistent with results in the greenhouse. Gall indices were not affected by C. parasiticum inoculations in the greenhouse or microplots. In both 2006 and 2007, a significant interaction between C. parasiticum inoculum densities and nematode level was observed on plant mortality. CBR inoculum greatly increased mortality on C724-19-25 and Georgia-02C, but not on C724-19-15, in the presence of M. arenaria. The mortality increase was more apparent at lower inoculum levels of both pathogens, but on the nematode-susceptible cultivars plant mortality was more with co-inoculations of the two pathogens than from either alone. Simultaneous inoculation with the two pathogens decreased yield of C724-19-25 and Georgia-02C as C. parasiticum inoculum levels increased, but even the largest inoculum of M. arenaria (2.0 eggs per cm(3) soil) did not decrease yield of C724-19-15.},

No-tillage has been adopted in much of the soybean production areas to preserve soil and nutrients. The impact of this production practice change on soybean cyst nematode has been evaluated since the introduction of the practice over thirty years ago and mixed results on the impact have been recorded. This study was initiated to determine if tillage practices and timing of changes impacted soybean cyst nematode reproduction. The study was imposed on a long-term tillage study and treatments were changed to measure short-term as well as long-term effects of tillage on soybean cyst nematode. Significant differences in soybean cyst nematode population density were found between treatments. However, significant differences found could be attributed to short-term changes in tilled and no-tilled treatments. Soybean cyst nematode reproduction was almost twice as high in treatments which changed from no-tillage to disc than tilled treatments changed to no-tillage. No significant differences were found in yield among the treatments. Grain yield was reflective of cultivar grown and environmental conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Twelve populations of Meloidogyne were collected and identified based on morphological characteristics as well as molecular methods including species-specific primers, confirming that all twelve populations were M. chitwoodi. To estimate genetic relationships among these twelve populations, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was done and the results were subjected to UPGM analysis. Analysis of 394 RAPD markers resulted in a similarity coefficient, ranging between 0.64 and 0.81 with a mean similarity of 0.72. The populations Mc3 and Mc4 displayed the greatest genetic similarity (81%). The lowest level of similarity (65%) was observed between Mc9 and Mc7. The large genetic variation among the M. chitwoodi populations indicates that multiple sources of inoculum might have been introduced to the region or that the populations formerly existed in these potato growing areas of Turkey.},

	Abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield has increased at a rate of 25 to 30 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) due in part to improved genetic gain, and has been further advanced by the addition of resistance to soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) in new cultivars. The objective was to determine specific growth changes that explain the yield improvement from old to new cultivars and the further yield improvement gained from the addition of SCN resistance. Studies were conducted at three Iowa locations during 2005 and 2006. Two old and two new SCN-susceptible, and two new SCN-resistant cultivars were evaluated for total dry matter (TDM) accumulation and leaf area index (LAI) through the season along with yield and yield components at harvest. New cultivars produced yields superior to older cultivars due to increased crop growth rate (CGR) culminating in greater TDM 105 days after emergence (DAE). Yield was strongly associated with the number of seeds produced m(-2) and this yield component accounted for almost all of the yield differences among cultivars. Seeds m-2 was positively related to CGR between 42 and 105 (growth stage R1-R5.5) DAE and to LAI 105 DAE. New SCN-resistant cultivars produced yields 17 to 19% greater than new susceptible cultivars across three locations. Increased TDM and CGR explained the yield response at the low-yield location, but not at the high-yield locations. Apparent harvest index (HI) was similar among all cultivars at each location. Selection for increased yield has indirectly selected for increased TDM and CGR with a similar amount partitioned to seed dry weight. Future yield gains will be made by (i) increasing the amount and the rate of dry matter (DM) and (ii) through the increased production and duration of leaf area.},

	Abstract = {Migration of plant-parasitic nematode infective larval stages through soil and invasion of roots requires perception and integration of sensory cues culminating in particular responses that lead to root penetration and parasite establishment. Components of the chemoreceptive neuronal circuitry involved in these responses are targets for control measures aimed at preventing infection. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first isolation of cyst nematode ace-2 genes encoding acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The ace-2 genes from Globodera pallida (Gp-ace-2) and Heterodera glycines (Hg-ace-2) show homology to ace-2 of Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce-ace-2). Gp-ace-2 is expressed most highly in the infective J2 stage with lowest expression in the early parasitic stages. Expression and functional analysis of the Globodera gene were carried out using the free-living nematode C. elegans in order to overcome the refractory nature of the obligate parasite G. pallida to many biological studies. Caenorhabditis elegans transformed with a GFP reporter construct under the control of the Gp-ace-2 promoter exhibited specific and restricted GFP expression in neuronal cells in the head ganglia. Gp-ACE-2 protein can functionally complement its C. elegans homologue. A chimeric construct containing the Ce-ace-2 promoter region and the Gp-ace-2 coding region and 31 untranslated region was able to restore a normal phenotype to the uncoordinated C. elegans double mutant ace-1;ace-2. This study demonstrates conservation of AChE function and expression between free-living and plant-parasitic nematode species, and highlights the utility of C. elegans as a heterologous system to study neuronal aspects of plant-parasitic nematode biology.

	Abstract = {The ascomycetous fungus Nectria haematococca, (asexual name Fusarium solani), is a member of a group of >50 species known as the "Fusarium solani species complex". Members of this complex have diverse biological properties including the ability to cause disease on >100 genera of plants and opportunistic infections in humans. The current research analyzed the most extensively studied member of this complex, N. haematococca mating population VI (MPVI). Several genes controlling the ability of individual isolates of this species to colonize specific habitats are located on supernumerary chromosomes. Optical mapping revealed that the sequenced isolate has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb and that the physical size of the genome, 54.43 Mb, and the number of predicted genes, 15,707, are among the largest reported for ascomycetes. Two classes of genes have contributed to gene expansion: specific genes that are not found in other fungi including its closest sequenced relative, Fusarium graminearum; and genes that commonly occur as single copies in other fungi but are present as multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI. Some of these additional genes appear to have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. The supernumerary nature of three chromosomes, 14, 15, and 17, was confirmed by their absence in pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments of some isolates and by demonstrating that these isolates lacked chromosome-specific sequences found on the ends of these chromosomes. These supernumerary chromosomes contain more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content in comparison to the other chromosomes. Although the origin(s) of the extra genes and the supernumerary chromosomes is not known, the gene expansion and its large genome size are consistent with this species' diverse range of habitats. Furthermore, the presence of unique genes on supernumerary chromosomes might account for individual isolates having different environmental niches.},

	Abstract = {Neotyphodium coenophialum, an endophytic fungus associated with tall fescue grass, enhances host fitness and imparts pest resistance. This symbiotum is implicated in the reduction of stresses, including plant-parasitic nematodes. To substantiate this implication, toxicological effects of root extracts, polyphenolic fraction, ergot, and loline alkaloids from endophyte-infected tall fescue were investigated using Pratylenchus scribneri, a nematode pest of tall fescue. In vitro bioassays and greenhouse studies were used as tests for effects of root fractions and compounds on motility and mortality of this lesion nematode. Greenhouse studies revealed that endophyte-infected tall fescue grasses are essentially nonhosts to P. scribneri, with root populations averaging 3 to 17 nematodes/pot, compared with 4,866 and 8,450 nematodes/pot for noninfected grasses. The in vitro assay indicated that root extracts from infected tall fescues were nematistatic. Polyphenols identified in extracts included chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acids, caffeic acid, and two unidentified compounds, but these were not correlated with endophyte status, qualitatively or quantitatively. Tests of several ergot alkaloids revealed that ergovaline and a-ergocryptine were nematicidal at 5 and 50 mu g/ml, respectively, while ergocornine and ergonovine were nematistatic at most concentrations. Loline (N-formylloline), the pyrrolizidine alkaloid tested, was nematicidal (50 to 200 mu g/ml). The ecological benefits of the metabolites tested here should assist in defining their role in deterring this nematode species while offering some probable mechanisms of action against plant-parasitic nematodes in general.},

	Abstract = {Worldwide, cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines is the most destructive pathogen on cultivated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). In the USA yield losses in 2001 were estimated to be nearly 60 million dollars. Crop losses are primarily reduced by the use of resistant cultivars. Nematode populations are variable and have adapted to reproduce on resistant cultivars overtime because resistance primarily traces to two soybean accessions. Recently cv. Hartwig was released which has comprehensive resistance to most SCN populations. A virulent nematode population LY1 was recently selected for its reproduction on Hartwig. LY1 population originated from a mass mating of Race 2 (HG Type 1.2.5-) females with Race 5 (HG Type 1.2-) males. LY1 nematode population infects currently known sources of resistance except PI 567516C. The female indices obtained on PI 567516C and Hartwig were 7% (resistant) and 155% (susceptible), respectively. However, the genetic basis of LY1 resistance in soybean PI 567516C is not known. Resistant PI line 567516C was crossed to susceptible cultivar Hartwig to generate 105 F-2:5 families. These families together with parents, seven indicator lines and a susceptible control cv. Lee-74 were evaluated for response to LY1 nematode population in the greenhouse. Chi-square analysis showed resistance in PI567516C to LY1 was conditioned by one dominant and two recessive genes (Rhg, rhg, rhg). Chi-square value was 0.15 and P = 0.70. This information will be useful to soybean researchers for developing resistant cultivars to nematode population that infects Hartwig.},

	Abstract = {A Survey in 2007-08 indicated the presence of 5 weed species belonging to 5 genera and 4 families infesting 13 field and vegetable crops. Among these five weed genotypes, there were two annual weed species (Brachiaria reptans and Chenopodium album) and three perennials including Achyranthes aspera, Rumex dentatus, and Solanum nigrum. All the weeds had distinct Meloidogyne incognita-root galling and egg masses but their number and size varied among the 5 weed genotypes. The 3 genotypes including A. aspera, C. album, and S. nigrum were graded good hosts and B. reptans and R. dentus as poor hosts. Our findings suggest that, in addition to egg stages, weed plants provide a means of survival for nematode populations which may contribute to the maintenance, reinfestation, multiplication and spread of nematodes, within a field, thus increasing the potential For crops to he damaged by nematode attacks.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), causes the most damaging chronic disease of soybean (Glycine max). Host resistance requires the resistance allele at rhg1. Resistance destroys the giant cells created in the plant's roots by the nematodes about 24 to 48 h after commencement of feeding. In addition, 4 to 8 d later, a systemic acquired resistance develops that discourages later infestations. The molecular mechanisms that control the rhg1-mediated resistance response appear to be multigenic and complex, as judged by transcript abundance changes, even in near isogenic lines (NILs). This study aimed to focus on key posttranscriptional changes by identifying proteins and metabolites that were increased in abundance in both resistant and susceptible NILs. Comparisons were made among NILs 10 d after SCN infestation and without SCN infestation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved more than 1,000 protein spots on each gel. Only 30 protein spots with a significant (P < 0.05) difference in abundance of 1.5-fold or more were found among the four treatments. The proteins in these spots were picked, trypsin digested, and analyzed using quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Protein identifications could be made for 24 of the 30 spots. Four spots contained two proteins, so that 28 distinct proteins were identified. The proteins were grouped into six functional categories. Metabolite analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified 131 metabolites, among which 58 were altered by one or more treatment; 28 were involved in primary metabolism. Taken together, the data showed that 17 pathways were altered by the rhg1 alleles. Pathways altered were associated with systemic acquired resistance-like responses, including xenobiotic, phytoalexin, ascorbate, and inositol metabolism, as well as primary metabolisms like amino acid synthesis and glycolysis. The pathways impacted by the rhg1 allelic state and SCN infestation agreed with transcript abundance analyses but identified a smaller set of key proteins. Six of the proteins lay within the same small region of the interactome identifying a key set of 159 interacting proteins involved in transcriptional control, nuclear localization, and protein degradation. Finally, two proteins (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [EC 5.3.1.9] and isoflavone reductase [EC 1.3.1.45]) and two metabolites (maltose and an unknown) differed in resistant and susceptible NILs without SCN infestation and may form the basis of a new assay for the selection of resistance to SCN in soybean.},

	Abstract = {Monitoring the population dynamics of a biocontrol agent in soil is important for understanding, predicting and increasing its efficacy. In this study, the population dynamics and the efficacy of a promising biocontrol agent against nematode, the fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis, were investigated in greenhouse experiments with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bioassay. To explore the effects of the fungus on nematode inoculum, soil infested with eggs or second-stage juveniles (J2) of Heterodera glycines was used. The results showed that the quantity of H. rhossiliensis DNA based on real-time PCR decreased over time, regardless of eggs or J2 as inoculum. The quantity of H. rhossiliensis DNA [femtogram (fg)/g soil] was highest (3.83 +/- 1.96 x 10(8) fg/g soil) when the fungus was first added to soil and then decreased rapidly to 3.24 +/- 1.22 x 10(7) fg/g in egg-infested soil and 7.34 +/- 2.94 x 10(7) fg/g in J2-infested soil 17 days after planting, and then declined gradually between 17 and 59 days after planting, The data based on the bioassay showed that the percentage of J2 parasitized by H. rhossiliensis decreased throughout the experiment in both egg- and J2-infested soils. H. rhossiliensis controlled H. glycines more effectively in J2-infested soil than in egg-infested soil. At the end of the experiments (59 days after planting), nematode suppression and plant growth promotion in J2-infested soil were 79% and 55%, respectively, which were higher than the 34% and 2% in egg-infested soil. In soil that was not inoculated with the fungus, the number of H. glycines was 10 times higher in J2-infested soil than in egg-infested soil, indicating the greater nematode inoculum potential in soil infested with J2. DNA yield of H. rhossiliensis was statistically higher in J2-infested soil than in egg-infested soil in earlier period (prior to day 31) (p < 0.05), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the numbers of J2 present during and soon after fungal inoculation are critical for maintaining the population density and biocontrol efficiency of the fungus.

	Abstract = {The ability to identify and manipulate environmental factors conducive for nematode suppression by organic amendments is essential. The impact that soil temperature and moisture, an additional source of nitrogen, and simulated tarping had on the ability of an alkaline-stabilized biosolid amendment (N-Viro Soil; NVS) to suppress Meloidogyne incognita was evaluated. A M. incognita-infested loamy sand was amended with 2% (dry w w(-1)) NVS plus urea (0.25 g L-1 dry soil) and incubated for 5 days at different temperatures (21, 26 and 31 degrees C), moistures (25, 50 and 75% of water holding capacity (WHC)) in an open or closed incubation environment. Soils were also amended with NVS or urea (additional nitrogen source), alone or in combination. Soil solution pH and ammonia (NH3) concentration (mM) were measured at 0, 3 and 5 days after amendment, and M. incognita reproduction on cucumber (eggs L-1 dry soil) was assessed. In all experiments soil solution pH increased rapidly after NVS amendment to approximately 10.5 under all factors; by the end of the experiments soil solution pH had decreased to 8.5-9.0 in NVS-amended soil. NVS plus urea amended to soil resulted in greater M. incognita suppression than either alone, or compared to an unamended control. This suppression was related to maximum and cumulative NH3 measured in soil over a 5-day period. Nematode suppression was not related to soil solution pH. For the tested factors (temperature, moisture, open vs. closed), M. incognita suppression was always greater in NVS plus urea-amended soil compared to the unamended controls, regardless of the tested factor. Differences within the factors were observed for NH3 dynamics in soil solution over time. High temperature (31 degrees C), low percentage of WHC (25%), and closed incubation resulted in at least twice as much NH3 being accumulated in soil, to levels above 100 mM NH3. Temperature appeared to have increased urea hydrolysis and combined with the high pH resulting from NVS amendment liberated NH3 + NH4+ from added urea accumulated as NH3 in soil. Reduced rates of NVS could be applied if combined with a labile source of nitrogen (urea) to promote the rapid production of NH3 under alkaline conditions. The ability of NVS to suppress M. incognita could also be improved by manipulation of the soil environment through irrigation and/or tarping. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in 44 soybean accessions including 23 wild soybeans, 8 landraces, and 13 soybean varieties (or lines), among which 5 in wild soybeans and 3 in landrace accessions were unique. Sequence diversity analysis on the 44 soybean accessions showed pi = 0.00168 and theta = 0.00218 for GmHs1(pro-1); landraces had the highest diversity, followed by wild soybeans, with varieties (or lines) having the lowest. Although we did not detect a significant effect of selection on GmHs1(pro-1) in the three populations, sequence diversity, unique SNPs, and phylogenetic analysis indicated a slight domestication bottleneck and an intensive selection bottleneck. High sequence diversity, more unique SNPs, and broader representation across the phylogenetic tree in wild soybeans and landraces indicated that wild collections and landrace accessions are invaluable germplasm for broadening the genetic base of elite soybean varieties resistant to SCN.},

Twenty-two SSR markers from 11 linkage groups were associated with resistance to SCN 4, and at Satt684, Sat_230, Sat_222, Satt615 and Satt231 loci, the allele from Hartwig was resistant type, while the allele from Jin 1261, Jin 1265 and Jin 1267 was susceptible. On the other hand, at the other 17 SSR loci, the allele from Hartwig was susceptible, while the allele from Jin 1261, Jin 1265 and Jin 1267 was resistant.

	Abstract = {Experiments were conducted in the laboratory and greenhouse to determine the effect of raw and anaerobically digested liquid swine manures on the hatch and viability of Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode. Anaerobic digestion was performed for 15 and 35 days to enrich volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonium (NH4+), respectively. All filtrates of the raw, VFA-enriched, and NH4+-enriched manures at 10(-1) to 250(-1) dilutions inhibited H. glycines hatch, and the reduction of hatch was increased with increasing concentration of the manure. Cumulative hatch at day 21 was only 2.1 % to 3.7% in the 10(-1) dilution manures, while the hatch in water was 21 % to 27.3%. The high concentrations appeared to be lethal to some eggs. Most second-stage juveniles (J2) of H. glycines were killed when incubated for 8 hours in the manure filtrate at the original concentration (>90% mortality) or for 48 hours at the 64(-1) dilution (> 82% mortality). When J2 were treated with the manures at 10(-1) to 250(-1) dilutions for 4 hours, only the 10(-1) dilution of VFA-enriched and raw manures resulted in a lower number of J2 that penetrated soybean roots as compared with lower concentrations. The VFA-enriched manure was the best, raw manure intermediate, and NH4+-enriched manure the least effective in inhibiting H. glycines hatch and killing eggs and J2.},

Sunn hemp, Illinois bundleflower, oilseed rape, perennial ryegrass, red clover, corn and H. glycines-susceptible soybean were compared for their effects on H. glycines hatch, viability and development in laboratory and glasshouse experiments. In the laboratory experiments, root exudates in soil leachates, extracts from fresh plant tissues, and extracts from residues of sunn hemp, red clover and soybean stimulated hatch of second-stage juveniles (J2) of H. glycines. All crops appeared to contain hatch inhibitors as well. There was no apparent effect of the root exudates and extracts from any of the crops on egg viability in vitro. When the H. glycines J2 were exposed to root exudates and extracts for 72 h, only the extracts of fresh plants and plant residue from sunn hemp, red clover and soybean, and the extract of plant residue from oilseed rape reduced viability of J2. In glasshouse experiments, residues of all crops, except Illinois bundleflower, reduced egg population density, with sunn hemp providing the greatest reduction. Residues of sunn hemp, red clover, and perennial ryegrass added to soil reduced the reproduction factor, suggesting the residues not only reduced egg population density but also reduced nematode infectivity. While all crops allowed penetration by J2, minimal development (to third- or fourth-stage juveniles only) occurred only in sunn hemp, red clover, oilseed rape and Illinois bundleflower, and full development occurred only in soybean. The results suggest that sunn hemp and red clover were the most effective rotation crops for managing H. glycines, and that stimulating hatch of H. glycines J2 was the main mechanism involved in reducing the H. glycines population density.},

	Abstract = {The nematode Xiphinema index is, economically, the major virus vector in viticulture, transmitting specifically the Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), the most severe grapevine virus disease worldwide. Increased knowledge of the spatial distribution of this nematode, both horizontally and vertically, and of correlative GFLV plant infections, is essential to efficiently control the disease. In two infested blocks of the Bordeaux vineyard, vertical distribution data showed that the highest numbers of individuals occurred at 40 to 110 cm depth, corresponding to the two layers where the highest densities of fine roots were observed. Horizontal distribution based on a 10 x 15 m grid sampling procedure revealed a significant aggregative pattern but no significant neighborhood structure of nematode densities. At a finer scale (approximate to 2 x 2 m), nematode sampling performed in a third block confirmed a significant aggregative pattern, with patches of 6 to 8 m diameter, together with a significant neighborhood structure of nematode densities, thus identifying the relevant sampling scale to describe the nematode distribution. Nematode patches correlate significantly with those of GFLV-infected grapevine plants. Finally, nematode and virus spread were shown to extend preferentially parallel to vine rows, probably due to tillage during mechanical weeding.},

	Abstract = {The effect produced by neem seed extracts and a neem seed concentrate (NSC) on the mortality and development of Heterodera glycines was evaluated. Second-stage juvenile (J2) mortality produced by the extracts and NSC was determined. Soybean seedlings treated with each of the extracts (aqueous, methanolic and hexane) were inoculated with J2 and the number of females and eggs per root system determined after 30 days. Both the hexane extracts were ineffective as no statistical difference (P>0.05) in J2 mortality was observed between them and the control. No statistical difference (P>0.05) in J2 mortality (>98%) was obtained between the water extracts and 2 methanol extract at 1000 mg L-1 treatments. The J2 percentage of mortality exponentially increased with the NSC dosages (R-2=0.94). LD50 was 42.6 mg L-1 for NSC on H. glycines. In the greenhouse experiment, the highest reduction in the number of females was 84%, obtained with the aqueous (41.6 mg L-1) and methanolic extracts (1000 mg L-1). In the same way, the highest reduction in the number of eggs, of about 90%, was obtained with the same extracts. Thus, using aqueous extracts is more suitable than the remaining extracts in field conditions. The activities of the methanol and NSC extracts were attributed to the seven tetranortritepenoids (azadirachtin H, azadirachtin A, azadirachtin B, desacetylnimbin, desacetylsalannin, nimbin and salannin) identified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.},

	Abstract = {Many nematode-antagonistic fungi produce secondary metabolites and enzymes that demonstrate toxicity against plant-parasitic nematodes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of fungal culture filtrates of Verticillium lecanii hybrid strains on mature eggs, embryonated eggs (eggs fertilized but without development of juveniles), and second-stage juveniles (J2) of Heterodera glycines and to compare these effects with those of their parental strains. The fungal culture filtrates of certain hybrid strains inhibited egg hatch of mature eggs. Furthermore, the fungal culture filtrates of two hybrid strains, AaF23 and AaF42, exhibited high toxicity against embryonated eggs of H. glycines. However, most of the fungal culture filtrates of V. lecanii did not inactivate J2. These results suggested that enzymes or other active compounds produced by the fungal culture filtrates of V. lecanii exhibit activity against specific stages in the H. glycines life cycle. In addition, based on a visual assessment of the morphological changes in eggs caused by filtrates of each strain, there were differences between the hybrid strains and their respective parental strains with regard to the active substances produced by V. lecanii against the embryonated eggs. As a result of promoting recombination of whole genomes via protoplast fusion, several hybrid strains may have enhanced production of active substances that are different from those produced by their parental strains. It was concluded that natural substances produced by V. lecanii are one of the important factors involved in the suppression of H. glycines damage. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {The current study was conducted to investigate the pathogenicity and its mode of action by Verticillium lecanii hybrid strains in different sedentary stages of Heterodera glycines. Three different sedentary stages (pale yellow female, yellow brown cyst, and dark brown cyst) of H. glycines were treated with V. lecanii and incubated for 3 weeks on water agar. After 3 weeks of incubation, eggs were investigated for the following parameters: (i) the infection frequencies of eggs, (ii) the number of eggs laid, and (iii) the number of mature and healthy eggs. Subsequently, the fecundity of H. glycines treated with V. lecanii was investigated in greater detail. Consequently, some strains had a greater ability to infect eggs and this significantly reduced the number of eggs laid and mature eggs in pale yellow females. This study indicates that V. lecanii is more effective on females rather than cysts of H. glycines and that V. lecanii may act on H. glycines in multiple ways.},

Here we describe the purification and characterization of the recombinant enzymes, named Bx-ENG-1, 2, and 3, expressed in Pichia pastoris. The respective molecular masses of purified Bx-ENG-1, 2, and 3 were estimated to be 18, 33-39, and 100-140kDa by SDS-PAGE, and 18, 67, and 252 kDa by gel filtration, suggesting that BxENG-1 existed in an unglycosylated monomeric form and Bx-ENG-2 and Bx-ENG-3 in a glycosylated dimeric form. The enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzymes were similar to each other: optimal activity at 60 degrees C at about pH 6.0, like other endoglucanases of GHF45. The recombinant enzymes displayed the highest activity toward lichenan, and lower activities were observed on carboxymethyl cellulose and amorphous cellulose. Nematode enzymes also hydrolyzed glucomannan, the most abundant hemicellulose in the cell walls of softwood. These substrate specificities suggest that B. xylophilus endoglucanases acted on the cellulose-hemicellulose complex in the cell walls, resulting in a weakening of the mechanical strength of the cell walls to facilitate the nematode's feeding on plant cells.},

We studied intercorrelations among soil and crop properties using factor analysis (FA) and principal components analysis (PCA), and their relationships with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] within-field yield variability. Site variables (22) measured on 0.2-ha cells of 12- to 20-ha areas of five Iowa fields were: elevation; soil texture; extractable nutrients; incidence of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) (SCN), diseases, and weeds; soybean dry weight (DW), height, and P and K uptake at V5; plant height at R5; and grain yield. Agronomic interpretations of interrelationships among site variables were more straightforward for FA than for PCA. The factors conditions for early growth and nutrient uptake and intrinsic soil properties were present in all fields, plant P and K availability was present in three fields, and the factor soybean pests, weeds or plant growth was present in the other fields. Factor analysis and PCA accounted for 62 to 64% of the yield. variability in the field with the largest yield CV (30%) and 5 to 35% in the other fields (CV 2.8 to 5.9%). Two factors related significantly to yield in two fields (plant P and K availability and intrinsic soil properties) while others were specific to one field. Factor analysis identified groups of interrelated site variables, showed how they accounted for yield variability, and showed that single measurements seldom account for most yield variation in a field.},

	Abstract = {Background: Many of the world's most important food crops have either polyploid genomes or homeologous regions derived from segmental shuffling following polyploid formation. The soybean (Glycine max) genome has been shown to be composed of approximately four thousand short interspersed homeologous regions with 1, 2 or 4 copies per haploid genome by RFLP analysis, microsatellite anchors to BACs and by contigs formed from BAC fingerprints. Despite these similar regions, the genome has been sequenced by whole genome shotgun sequence (WGS). Here the aim was to use BAC end sequences (BES) derived from three minimum tile paths (MTP) to examine the extent and homogeneity of polyploid-like regions within contigs and the extent of correlation between the polyploid-like regions inferred from fingerprinting and the polyploid-like sequences inferred from WGS matches. Results: Results show that when sequence divergence was 1-10%, the copy number of homeologous regions could be identified from sequence variation in WGS reads overlapping BES. Homeolog sequence variants (HSVs) were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 89%) and single nucleotide indels (SNIs 10%). Larger indels were rare but present (1%). Simulations that had predicted fingerprints of homeologous regions could be separated when divergence exceeded 2% were shown to be false. We show that a 5-10% sequence divergence is necessary to separate homeologs by fingerprinting. BES compared to WGS traces showed polyploid-like regions with less than 1% sequence divergence exist at 2.3% of the locations assayed. Conclusion: The use of HSVs like SNPs and SNIs to characterize BACs wil improve contig building methods. The implications for bioinformatic and functional annotation of polyploid and paleopolyploid genomes show that a combined approach of BAC fingerprint based physical maps, WGS sequence and HSV-based partitioning of BAC clones from homeologous regions to separate contigs will allow reliable de-convolution and positioning of sequence scaffolds (see BES_ scaffolds section of SoyGD). This approach will assist genome annotation for paleopolyploid and true polyploid genomes such as soybean and many important cereal and fruit crops.},

	Abstract = {Parasite proteins secreted at the interface of nematode and host are believed to play an essential role in parasitism. Here, we present an efficient pipeline of bio-informatic algorithms and laboratory experiments to identify candidate parasitism genes within nematode secretomes, i.e. the repertoire of secreted proteins in an organism. We performed our approach on 12 218 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) originating from three life stages of the plant parasitic nematode Meloidogyne chitwoodi-a molecularly unexplored root-knot nematode species. The ESTs from M. chitwoodi were assembled into 5880 contigs and open reading frames translated from the consensus sequences were searched for features of putative signal peptides for protein secretion and trans-membrane regions, resulting in the identification of 398 secretome members. The products of parasitism genes are secreted by a range of organs, including the oesophageal, amphidial and rectal glands, the intestine, and the hypodermis. To localize the site of expression in M. chitwoodi, we subjected the most abundant secretome members to in situ hybridization microscopy. We found hybridization of one tag in the dorsal oesophageal gland, seven in the two subventral oesophageal glands, two in the intestine and one tag hybridized to the tail tip in the proximity of the phasmids. Four sequences showed similarity to putative parasitism genes from other nematode species, whereas seven represented pioneering sequences. Our approach presents an efficient method to identify candidate parasitism genes, which does not require sophisticated cDNA isolation and selection protocols, and can therefore be used as a powerful starting point for the molecular investigation of parasites.},

We cloned and sequenced cDNA encoding six protease inhibitors expressed in soybean roots infected with soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and determined their expression patterns. Four of these protease inhibitors are novel and have not been reported previously. Using RT-PCR, we measured the relative transcript levels of each protease inhibitor in roots of the soybean cv. Peking inoculated with either SCN TN8 to examine the expression of protease inhibitors during the susceptible interaction or with SCN NL1-RHg representing the resistant interaction. Within 12 to 24 hours, mRNA transcripts encoding five of the six protease inhibitors were more highly elevated in soybean roots exhibiting the susceptible interaction than the resistant interaction. Transcripts encoding two protease inhibitors possessing Kunitz trypsin inhibitor domains were induced 37- and 27-fold in the susceptible interaction within 1 dpi, but were induced only 5- to 7-fold in roots displaying the resistant interaction. Our results indicate that soybean roots recognize differences between these two SCN populations before the nematodes initiate a feeding site, and accordingly the roots express transcripts encoding soybean protease inhibitors differentially. These transcripts were generally less abundant in roots exhibiting the resistant interaction.},

The reconstruction is compared with previous work on bacteriovorous cephalobids and rhabditids to better understand the evolution of the stylet and its associated cells. Two arcade syncytia ("guide ring") line the stylet shaft, supporting the hypothesis that the stylet shaft and cone (into which the shaft extends and which is not lined by syncytia) are homologous with the gymnostom of cephalobids, the sister taxon of tylenchids. Epidermal syncytia, HypA, HypB, HypC, and HypE, line the cephalic framework, vestibule, and vestibule extension, congruent with the hypothesis that these components are homologous with the cephalobid cheilostom. Relative to outgroups, HypC is expanded in A. avenae, enclosing sensilla that fill most of the cephalic framework. The homolog of syncytium HypD in the cephalobid Acrobeles complexus is not observed in A. avenae. Arcade syncytia are reduced compared with those of cephalobids. Stylet protractor muscles in A. avenae are homologous with the most anterior set of radial muscles of cephalobids. Observations to date test and verify our previous hypotheses of homology of the stomatostylet with respect to the stoma of bacteriovorous outgroups. Reconstruction of the stegostom and pharynx will provide further tests of homology and evolution of feeding structure adaptations for plant parasitism.},

Unless the system changes dramatically to produce soybean every third or fourth year, severe pressure will be continue and will reduce the likelihood of sustainable soybean production. In the foreseeable future, genetic resistance of soybean coupled with crop rotation will be the foundation of any management system for Heterodera glycines. Marker assisted selection will aid in selection and incorporation of specific genes and will increase the efficiency of developing resistant cultivars. However, any source of resistance may not be durable even with sound nematode management practices. Rotation of resistance genes (sources of resistance) has met with some success and may increase durability of sources of resistance. Integrating biological control in the production system with promising organisms such as Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Pasteuria nishizawae may lead to a truly sustainable system of soybean production in which H. glycines is no longer a yield limiting production factor.},

Moench] infested with Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines. Foliar symptom severity was rated 21 days after emergence. The cone and field SDS ratings were significantly correlated and ranged from 0.69 forset 1 to 0.51 forset 3. Correlations of SDS ratings of genotypes between field and greenhouse tray ratings were significant forset 1 and not significant for set 2. The cone method showed the highest correlation with field results and is recommended to screen soybean genotypes for SDS resistance.},

	Abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max (L.)Merr.] seed yield is often limited by root-infecting pathogens. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of three root-infecting seedling pathogens in a fumigated vs. a nonfumigated soil, to determine if incidence is greater in cultivars that lack resistance to soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, SCN), and how incidence of these pathogens relates to yield. From 2004 through 2006, a 2 ha section of a field was fumigated each year with a mixture of 1,3 dichloropropene + chloropicrin on a Webster clay loam at Nevada (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls), and on a Salix silty clay loam at Whiting (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls), IA. Average incidence in the nonfumigated sites (determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] tests) was 86, 47, and 9% for Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora sojae, respectively. Fumigation increased yield by 10%, reduced Pythium spp. incidence 27%, and no reductions in incidence of R. solani and P. sojae were detected. Incidence of Pythium spp. and P. sojae was less for cultivars with resistance to SCN. Negative correlations were found of yield with root health ratings (-0.43), SCN initial populations (-0.37), the presence of Pythium spp. (-0.28), and A sojae (-0.15). Pythium spp. were more prevalent than R. solani and P. sojae in soybean seedlings in Iowa, and it was more related to yield than the other two pathogens. More research is needed to investigate the possibility of SCN-susceptible cultivars being exposed to greater Pythium spp. and A sojae damage which may influence yield.},

	Abstract = {Site-specific (precision) management (SSM) has potential for application in managing nematodes and soil conditions in environmentally meaningful ways. Successful application of SSM, however, may be dependent on how agronomically, biologically, and ecologically integrated the plan in question is. Otherwise, SSM risks falling into the "Tried but did not last" category. With this background and in addition to describing the concepts and principles of SSM, this presentation discusses the following interrelated points: (1) Case studies of spatio-temporal analysis of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) infestations, soil conditions and crop yield in managed ecosystems. Among the critical factors to an accurate and sustained application of SSM are understanding (i) the temporal structure and (ii) the spatial structure of the attribute in question, and (iii) establishing cause-and-effect relationships in the prevailing conditions. New approaches to temporal structure analysis when balancing the purpose of SSM application and nematode biology (as it relates to life stages), population density in soil and root tissue (to determine threshold), and damage functions (physiological stress of the plant during the growing season) are outlined. (2) Application of the concept of fertiliser use efficiency (FUE) to identify soil conditions when managing soil fertility. Defined as increase in host productivity and/or decrease in plant-parasitic nematode population density in response to a given fertiliser treatment, the FUE model recognizes variable responses and identifies four categories of interactions necessary for integrated management decision-making options that account for agronomic, economic, ecological and environmental and pest management issues. (3) Approaches to changing soil conditions in agro-biologically integrated ways. By incorporating nematode community structure (an excellent indicator of soil bio-ecological changes), soil nutrient amendments and crop yield, we have described a modification of the FUE model to identify and monitor changes in soil conditions, thereby creating the necessary bridges to disciplinary and cross-disciplinary gaps and interactions.},

Low-temperature treatments caused a significant decrease in total percent egg hatch relative to untreated controls, but did not affect either the timing of egg hatch or the qualitative aspects of the hatch curve. Hatch curves comprised 3 distinct phases: hatch initiation (I), linear increase (II), and hatch rate decline (III). Hatch rates for all treatments were greatest during the first 12 d following hatch assay initiation, and rate decline occurred by day 14 regardless of treatment. Egg viability tests based upon vital staining demonstrated that refrigeration did not affect mortality, and monitoring progeny eggs obtained from plants inoculated with refrigerated eggs did not reveal any effect on hatching. Total percent hatch was directly dependent upon phase II linear increase rate. Depression of hatch by low temperature was not reversed when eggs were returned to 27 degrees C. Results suggest that I or more developmental events were arrested, and that a diapause was induced.},

Hatching of J2 from cultured eggs was robust, whereas J2 from field eggs hatched very poorly in vitro (< 1% total cumulative percentage hatch). Qualitative aspects of hatch were stable as hatching of J2 from eggs from all sources was linear from 2 through to 8-10 days. By contrast, quantitative aspects were more variable. Total cumulative percentage hatch typically ranged from 45 to 70% but approached 90% depending upon the source of the cultured eggs. Egg density (eggs/cm(2)) affected hatch of J2 in the large scale in vitro system, with total cumulative percentage hatch significantly greater at 3 100 eggs/cm(2) than at 420 eggs/cm2. The poor hatch of J2 from field eggs was lost after two generations in culture and replaced by the typical hatch characteristics of J2 from eggs from an established culture.

The behavioural responses of Heterodera glycines and Meloidogyne incognita to treatments of serotonin, octopamine and dopamine were qualitatively similar, but significant quantitative differences between the species were revealed. The frequency of J2 head movement was decreased by as little as 250 mu M serotonin in H. glycines and 500 mu M serotonin in M. incognita, with effective doses (ED50) of 0.73 mM for H. glycines and 1.72 mM for M. incognita. Octopamine had the opposite effect of serotonin, increasing J2 head movement frequency at thresholds of 2 mM in H. glycines and I mM in M. incognita. Octopamine ED50 values were 32.35 mM and 1.91 mM, respectively. Dopamine had no effect on head movement in either species up to concentrations of 20 mM. Serotonin inhibited hatch in both species but was more potent against H. glycines (90% inhibition at 1 mM) than M. incognita (40% inhibition at 5 mM). Octopamine reduced hatch equally in both species with over 95% inhibition at 80 mM. Dopamine had no effect on hatch in M. incognita but did inhibit H. glycines hatch over 60% at 40 mM. The value of detailed quantitative analyses of plant-parasitic nematode responses to biogenic amines for studies on nematode control is discussed.},

Areas within the soyabean intercrop with symptoms of stunting, root rot, and interveinal chlorosis or necrosis were observed. In 2004 and 2005, these patches covered 253 and 738 m(2,) respectively, in the intercrop and were all found in the vicnity of black walnut. No paptches were found in an adjacent soybean monoculture. Fusarium solani was isolated from diseased plants and Koch postulates completed, but the pathogen did not induce the stuning symptoms observed in the field. A role for juglone (1x10(-5) mol/L jiglone, which can explain the observed stunting.

Field and controlled environment observations point to an association, previously unreported to our knowledge, among F. solani, black walnut, and soybean disease. Tolerence of the pathogen to juglone and soybean stunting due to juglone are also novel findings, but more data are needed to concluvisely prove the link with the allelopathic compound.},

HG Type 0 (race 3) was the most common with 94% frequency, whereas HG Type 7 (race 6) was found in 6% of tested populations. Most populations of H. glycines parasitised PI88788 and PI548316. Eight of the most commonly used soybean cultivars were tested against H. glycines HG Type 0; seven of them, Sepideh, Sahar (Pershing), Gorgan 3, Williams 82, JK (Sari), BP (Telar) and Hill, had high female indices and were considered susceptible to HG Type 0. Only the cultivar DPX showed low female indices and was resistant to race 3. The initial observations showed that the first life cycle of SCN required 30-34 days in early-planted fields (late May and early June), whereas in late-planted fields (early July), white females were visible 20 days after planting.

	Abstract = {Chorismate mutase (CM) secreted from the stylet of plant-parasitic nematodes plays an important role in plant parasitism. We isolated and characterized a new nematode CM gene (Gr-cm-1) from the potato cyst nematode, Globodera rostochiensis. The Gr-cm-1 gene was found to exist in the nematode genome as a single-copy gene that has two different alleles, Gr-cm-1A and Gr-cm-1B, both of which could give rise to two different mRNA transcripts of Gr-cm-1 and Gr-cm-1-IRII In situ mRNA hybridization showed that the Gr-cm-1 gene was exclusively expressed within the subventral oesophageal gland cells of the nematode. Gr-cm-1 was demonstrated to encode a functional CM (GR-CM-1) potentially having a dimeric structure as the secreted bacterial *AroQ CMs. Gr-cm-1-IRII, generated by retention of intron 2 of the Gr-cm-1 pre-mRNA through alternative splicing (AS), would encode a truncated protein (GR-CM-1t) lacking the CM domain with no CM activity. The quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay revealed that splicing of the Gr-cm-1 gene was developmentally regulated; Gr-cm-1 was up-regulated whereas Gr-cm-1-IRII was down-regulated in early nematode parasitic stages compared to the preparasitic juvenile stage. Low-temperature SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that GR-CM-1 could form homodimers when expressed in Escherichia coli and the dimerization domain was retained in the truncated GR-CM-1t protein. The specific interaction between the two proteins was demonstrated in yeast. Our data suggested that the novel splice variant might function as a dominant negative isoform through heterodimerization with the full-length GR-CM-1 protein and that AS may represent an important mechanism for regulating CM activity during nematode parasitism.

	Abstract = {The Chinese genebank contains 23,587 soybean landraces collected from 29 provinces. In this study, a representative collection of 1,863 landraces were assessed for genetic diversity and genetic differentiation in order to provide useful information for effective management and utilization. A total of 1,160 SSR alleles at 59 SSR loci were detected including 97 unique and 485 low-frequency alleles, which indicated great richness and uniqueness of genetic variation in this core collection. Seven clusters were inferred by STRUCTURE analysis, which is in good agreement with a neighbor-joining tree. The cluster subdivision was also supported by highly significant pairwise F-st values and was generally in accordance with differences in planting area and sowing season. The cluster HSuM, which contains accessions collected from the region between 32.0 and 40.5 degrees N, 105.4 and 122.2 degrees E along the central and downstream parts of the Yellow River, was the most genetically diverse of the seven clusters. This provides the first molecular evidence for the hypotheses that the origin of cultivated soybean is the Yellow River region. A high proportion (95.1%) of pairs of alleles from different loci was in LD in the complete dataset. This was mostly due to overall population structure, since the number of locus pairs in LD was reduced sharply within each of the clusters compared to the complete dataset. This shows that population structure needs to be accounted for in association studies conducted within this collection. The low value of LD within the clusters can be seen as evidence that much of the recombination events in the past have been maintained in soybean, fixed in homozygous self-fertilizing landraces.},

The objective of this study was to use spatial regression tools to map the spatial variability of spectral response of a soybean crop to SCN infestation. Field experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 on a soybean field at the University of Arkansas Pine Tree Experiment Station. The SCN distribution in the field was assessed twice each year Airborne visible-infrared imagery was acquired during both seasons. Linear regression analysis showed that SCN had no effect (R-2 < 0.2) on yield and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) derived from aerial imagery on a single date. Spatial regression models on SCN incorporating the semivariogram of residuals of the ordinary least square regression accounted for 70% of the variability in GNDVI and 78% of the variability in yield. They indicated that spatial regression is a better tool than simple linear regression for analyzing soybean response to SCN infestation.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is a serious pest that needs to be managed in soybean production. This pest is difficult to detect at its onset, as symptoms deleterious to the plant are not dramatic. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of SCN resistance rotation on SCN distribution as well as on soybean canopy reflectance and grain yield. A 0.8 ha field was planted with soybeans under eleven resistance rotation treatments. Two sets of SCN counts and three airborne visible-infrared images were obtained during the 2004 season. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the resistance rotation treatment explained 59% and 64% of variability in cyst and egg counts at planting, and 55% and 57% of variability in cyst and egg counts at harvest. The yield was lowest in all the plots under cultivar Manokin, and monoculture of Hutcheson or Hutcheson treated with the nematicide Temik, while the highest yields occurred in plots under cultivar Anand. The SCN population densities at planting and harvest and grain yield were correlated to the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) at P < 0.1. However, there was no relationship between SCN population densities and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and green NDVI (GNDVI) on any given date in the season. This study indicated that the resistance rotation was effective in managing SCN in the field. Remote sensing showed potential in identifying SCN damage under the low to moderate infestation. This study also elucidates the complex relationship between SCN population density in the soil and potential crop damage and the difficulty in assessing SCN infestation.},

Selected cultivars were tested in a field of sandy loam soil naturally infested with M. incognita and Heterodera glycines Ichinohe (2004) or in a silt loam soil artificially infested with M. incognita (2005). In 2004, H444NRR was resistant to M. incognita, but not to H. glycines; LS943207 and LNX97164-35-5 were resistant to both nematodes; Gateway 427, H444NRR, LNX9716435-5, and SB4399CT were moderately resistant to M. incognita in greenhouse tests; HF96652-15 was resistant to M. incognita but highly susceptible to H. glycines. In 2005, LS94-3207, H444NRR, LNX97164-35-5, and Manokin were resistant to M. incognita. In microplots with two sandy loam soils, HF9665-2-15 exhibited tolerance to increasing inoculum levels of M. incognita. High-yielding soybean cultivars in maturity groups 11 to IV with resistance and tolerance to M. incognita were identified. Under field conditions, resistance to the more widespread nematode H. glycines, combined with resistance to M. incognita, is highly desirable to reduce the risk of yield reduction and to improve cropping sequences that include soybean.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) is an obligate parasite of soybean (Glycine max). It is the most destructive pathogen of G. max, accounting for approximately 0.46-0.82 billion dollars in crop losses, annually, in the U.S. Part of the infection process involves H. glycines establishing feeding sites (syncytia) that it derives its nourishment from throughout its lifecycle. Microscopic methods (i.e., laser capture microdissection [LCM]) that faithfully dissect out those feeding sites are important improvements to the study of this significant plant pathogen. Our isolation of developing feeding sites during an incompatible or a compatible reaction is providing new ways by which this important plant-pathogen interaction can be studied. We have used these methods to create cDNA libraries, clone genes and perform microarray analyses. Importantly, it is providing insight not only into how the root is responding at the organ level to H. glycines, but also how the syncytium is responding during its maturation into a functional feeding site.},

We demonstrate that MiniMax is able to make somatic embryos (SEs) that rapidly develop into plantlets. Thus, the rapid cycling habit carries over into aspects of plant regeneration. Chimaeras (having transformed roots with untransformed aerial stocks) have been produced rapidly under non-axenic conditions using Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. Part of these experiments involved the engineering an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter cassette outside the multi-cloning site of a plant expression vector, permitting non-invasive visual screening of the transformed roots. The rapid cycling growth habit of MiniMax, its ability to efficiently generate SEs and ability to be transformed should prove useful for basic aspects of G. max molecular and genetic research.},

	Abstract = {Radopholus similis is an important nematode pest on fruit crops in the tropics. Unraveling the transcriptome of this migratory plant-parasitic nematode can provide insight in the parasitism process and lead to more efficient control measures. For the first high throughput molecular characterization of this devastating nematode, 5,853 expressed sequence tags from a mixed stage population were generated. Adding 1,154 tags from the EST division of GenBank for subsequent analysis, resulted in a total of 7,007 ESTs, which represent approximately 3,200 genes. The mean G + C content of the nucleotides at the third codon position (GC3%) was calculated to be as high as 64.8%, the highest for nematodes reported to date. BLAST-searches resulted in about 70% of the clustered ESTs having homology to (DNA and protein) sequences from the GenBank database, whereas one-third of them did not match to any known sequence. Roughly 40% of these latter sequences are predicted to be coding, representing putative novel protein coding genes. Functional annotation of the sequences by GO annotation revealed the abundance of genes involved in reproduction and development, which reflects the nematode population biology. Genes with a role in the parasitism process are identified, as well as genes essential for nematode survival, providing information useful for parasite control. No evidence was found for the presence of trans-spliced leader sequences commonly occurring in nematodes, despite the use of various approaches. In conclusion, we found three different sources for the EST sequences: the majority has a nuclear origin, approximately 1% of the EST sequences are derived from the mitochondrial transcriptome, and interestingly, 1% of the tags are with high probability derived from Wolbachia, providing the first molecular indication for the presence of this endosymbiont in a plant-parasitic nematode.},

	Abstract = {Large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are now available for a number of crop species. However, the high-throughput methods for multiplexing SNP assays are untested in complex genomes, such as soybean, that have a high proportion of paralogous genes. The Illumina GoldenGate assay is capable of multiplexing from 96 to 1,536 SNPs in a single reaction over a 3-day period. We tested the GoldenGate assay in soybean to determine the success rate of converting verified SNPs into working assays. A custom 384-SNP GoldenGate assay was designed using SNPs that had been discovered through the resequencing of five diverse accessions that are the parents of three recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations. The 384 SNPs that were selected for this custom assay were predicted to segregate in one or more of the RIL mapping populations. Allelic data were successfully generated for 89% of the SNP loci (342 of the 384) when it was used in the three RIL mapping populations, indicating that the complex nature of the soybean genome had little impact on conversion of the discovered SNPs into usable assays. In addition, 80% of the 342 mapped SNPs had a minor allele frequency > 10% when this assay was used on a diverse sample of Asian landrace germplasm accessions. The high success rate of the GoldenGate assay makes this a useful technique for quickly creating high density genetic maps in species where SNP markers are rapidly becoming available.},

Cluster analysis separated the accessions into three clusters. Most Japanese cultivars were found in cluster 1, which was further divided into three subclusters that corresponded to the geographic origin of the cultivars. Most foreign cultivars and all wild accessions were present in clusters 2 and 3, respectively.

	Abstract = {Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes secrete a complex of cell wall-digesting enzymes, which aid in root penetration and migration. The soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines also produces a cellulose binding protein (Hg CBP) secretory protein. To determine the function of CBP, an orthologous cDNA clone (Hs CBP) was isolated from the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii, which is able to infect Arabidopsis thaliana. CBP is expressed only in the early phases of feeding cell formation and not during the migratory phase. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing Hs CBP developed longer roots and exhibited enhanced susceptibility to H. schachtii. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified Arabidopsis pectin methylesterase protein 3 (PME3) as strongly and specifically interacting with Hs CBP. Transgenic plants overexpressing PME3 also produced longer roots and exhibited increased susceptibility to H. schachtii, while a pme3 knockout mutant showed opposite phenotypes. Moreover, CBP overexpression increases PME3 activity in planta. Localization studies support the mode of action of PME3 as a cell wall-modifying enzyme. Expression of CBP in the pme3 knockout mutant revealed that PME3 is required but not the sole mechanism for CBP overexpression phenotype. These data indicate that CBP directly interacts with PME3 thereby activating and potentially targeting this enzyme to aid cyst nematode parasitism.},

	Abstract = {Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes induce the formation of specialized feeding cells in infected roots, which involves plant developmental processes that have been shown to be influenced by microRNAs (miRNAs) and other small RNAs. This observation provided the foundation to investigate the potential involvement of small RNAs in plant-cyst nematode interactions. First, we examined the susceptibilities of Arabidopsis DICER-like (dcl) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (rdr) mutants to the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. The examined mutants exhibited a trend of decreased susceptibility, suggesting a role of small RNAs mediating gene regulation processes during the plant-nematode interaction. Second, we generated two small RNA libraries from aseptic Arabidopsis roots harvested at 4 and 7 days after infection with surface-sterilized H. schachtii. Sequences of known miRNAs as well as novel small interfering (si)RNAs were identified. Following this discovery, we used real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to quantify a total of 15 Arabidopsis transcripts that are known targets of six of the different miRNA families found in our study (miR160, miR164, miR167, miR171, miR396, and miR398) in inoculated and noninoculated Arabidopsis roots. Our analyses showed mostly negative correlations between miRNA accumulation and target gene mRNA abundance, suggesting regulatory roles of these miRNAs during parasitism. Also, we identified a total of 125 non-miRNA siRNAs. Some of these siRNAs perfectly complement protein-coding mRNAs or match transposon or retrotransposon sequences in sense or antisense orientations. We further quantified a group of siRNAs in H. schachtii-inoculated roots. The examined siRNAs exhibited distinct expression patterns in infected and noninfected roots, providing additional evidence for the implication of small RNAs in cyst nematode parasitism. These data lay the foundation for detailed analyses of the functions of small RNAs during phytonematode parasitism.},

	Abstract = {Grape phylloxera, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Fitch) (Hemiptera Phylloxeridae) is a damaging pest of grapevines (Vitis spp.) around the world, and the management of this pest requires early detection of infestations. Here, we describe the development and validation of a sensitive DNA test for grape phylloxera that can be applied to soil. Species-specific primers were developed for grape phylloxera in the internal transcribed space region 2, and their specificity was confirmed after thorough screening by using a wide range of vineyard organisms and aphid genera. Preliminary testing of the detection limits of the grape phylloxera-specific primers was conducted using field-sourced soil types spiked with a known number of grape phylloxera. The assay was converted to a real-time polymerase chain reaction format (TaqMan MCB). This assay, in combination with DNA extraction from soil, can detect phylloxera crawlers added to soil. The assay was evaluated in the field at a recently detected grape phylloxera infestation site front the Yarra Valley in Victoria, Australia. The DNA assay proved to be substantially more sensitive than a standard ground survey for detecting grape phylloxera presence on vine roots in the infested vineyard. Moreover, unlike the ground survey, the assay provided quantitative information on grape phylloxera infestations, because grape phylloxera DNA concentrations in samples from vines closely matched the numbers of grape phylloxera crawlers collected with emergence traps placed at the base of vines. Unlike other detection techniques, the method can be applied at any time of the year, and it can be potentially modified to provide specific information on the virulence levels of the particular grape phylloxera genotypes responsible for any new infestations.},

	Abstract = {Purple deadnettle is an obligate winter annual weed and an alternate host of soybean cyst nematode (SCN). Field experiments were conducted using microplots to determine (1) the effect of purple deadnettle planting date and (2) the effect of purple deadnettle removal time on SCN egg population density in continuous no-tillage soybean. A population change factor (PCF) to assess treatment effects on SCN population densities was calculated by dividing the SCN population density at each sampling time (Pf) by the initial population density before treatments were applied (Pi). In the planting date experiment, purple deadnettle seeded on October 3, 11, and 18 resulted in PCF values ranging from 7.28 to 11.41, which were three- to fivefold higher than the PCF values for the weed-free control or purple deadnettle seeded on September 6, 20, and 27. Self-thinning of purple deadnettle seeded in September may have resulted in higher levels of SCN mortality compared to later seeding dates. In the removal time experiment, purple deadnettle removal at 2 and 4 wk after emergence (WAE) resulted in PCF values of 1.19 and 1.54, respectively, which were similar to the PCF for the weed-free control. In contrast, PCF values for purple deadnettle removal times of 6 WAE or later ranged from 2.46 to 5.44. Field and greenhouse experiments provided evidence that completion of the SCN life cycle on purple deadnettle was prevented if the weed was removed before the accumulation of 380 soil degree days within the 5 to 30 C range. Results from the removal study also suggested that completion of the first SCN generation on purple deadnettle in the fall was the primary factor causing increases in egg population density, since PCF values did not continue to increase significantly beyond the 6 WAE removal time.},

	Abstract = {Endo-1,4-beta-glucanases, which can degrade cellulose, have been identified in a number of plant-parasitic nematodes, mainly sedentary endoparasites. This study reports the discovery of four different endoglucanases of glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) in the migratory endoparasitic nematode Radopholus similis. Spatial expression of the corresponding genes was analysed by in situ hybridization, which showed the presence of transcripts in the pharyngeal gland cells. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR on different developmental stages was performed to study the temporal expression pattern. Three of the endoglucanase genes showed reduced expression in adult males compared with that in females. This could be explained by the fact that males do not feed and are considered non-parasitic. Only one of the endoglucanase genes was expressed in juveniles. The four corresponding proteins had a putative signal peptide for secretion and a catalytic domain. Two of the proteins had an additional linker and carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). Modelling of the catalytic domain resulted in the alpha/beta-barrel typical for GHF5 endoglucanases. Mapping the conserved amino acids of the four endoglucanases onto the 3D structure revealed that most were positioned near the catalytic centre of the protein, whereas less conserved amino acids occurred more often in the alpha helices, pointing towards the outside of the protein. Analyses of guanine/cytosine (GC) contents and codon adaptation indices indicated that the endoglucanase genes were well adapted to the codon usage of R. similis. The GC and GC3 (GC content of the third position of the codons) contents of the endoglucanases were significantly higher than the average for all Radopholus ESTs (expressed sequence tags).},

	Abstract = {Chitin, the most abundant aminopolysaccharide in nature, is a rigid and resistant structural component that contributes to the mechanical strength of chitin-containing organisms. Chemically, it is a linear cationic heteropolysaccharide composed of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine units. The enzymatic degradation of chitin is performed by a chitinolytic system with synergistic and consecutive action. Diverse organisms (containing chitin or not) produce a great variety of chitinolytic enzymes with different specificities and catalytic properties. Their physiological roles involve nutrition, parasitism, chitin recycling, morphogenesis, and/or defense. Microorganisms, as the main environmental chitin degraders, constitute a very important natural source of chitinolytic enzymes. Nowadays, the most used method for pest and plant diseases control is the utilization of chemical agents, causative of significant environmental pollution. Social concern has generated the search for alternative control systems (i.e., biological control), which contribute to the generation of sustainable agricultural development. Interactions among the different organisms are the natural bases of biological control. Interest in chitinolytic enzymes in the field of biological control has arisen due to their possible involvement in antagonistic activity against pathogenic chitin-containing organisms. The absence of chitin in plants and vertebrate animals allows the consideration of safe and selective "target" molecules for control of chitin-containing pathogenic organisms. Fungi show appropriate characteristics as potential biological control agents of insects, fungi, and nematodes due to the production of fungal enzymes with antagonistic action. The antagonistic interactions between fungi and plant nematode parasites are among the most studied experimental models because of the high economic relevance. Fungi which target nematodes are known as nematophagous fungi. The nematode egg is the only structural element where the presence of chitin has been demonstrated. In spite of being one of the most resistant biological structures, eggs are susceptible to being attacked by egg-parasitic fungi. A combination of physical and chemical phenomena result in their complete destruction. The contribution of fungal chitinases to the in vitro rupture of the eggshell confirms their role as a pathogenic factor. Chitinases have been produced by traditional fermentation methods, which have been improved by optimizing the culture conditions for industrial processes. Although wild-type microorganisms constitute an alternative source of chitinolytic enzymes, the advances in molecular biology are allowing the genetic transformation of fungi to obtain strains with high capability as biocontrol agents. Simultaneously, a better understanding of rhizosphere interactions, additional to the discovery of new molecular biology tools, will allow the choosing of better alternatives for the biological control of nematodes in order to achieve an integrated management of the soil ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Fungi in the genus Lecanicillium (formerly classified as the single species Verticillium lecanii) are important pathogens of insects and some have been developed as commercial biopesticides. Some isolates are also active against phytoparasitic nematodes or fungi. Lecanicillium spp. use both mechanical forces and hydrolytic enzymes to directly penetrate the insect integument and the cell wall of the fungal plant pathogen. In addition to mycoparasitism of the plant pathogen, the mode of action is linked to colonization of host plant tissues, triggering an induced systemic resistance. Recently it was demonstrated that development of Lecanicillium hybrids through protoplast fusion may result in strains that inherit parental attributes, thereby allowing development of hybrid strains with broader host range and other increased benefits, such as increased viability. Such hybrids have demonstrated increased virulence against aphids, whiteflies and the soybean cyst nematode. Three naturally occurring species of Lecanicillium, L. attenuatum, L. longisporum, and an isolate that could not be linked to any presently described species based on rDNA sequences have been shown to have potential to control aphids as well as suppress the growth and spore production of Sphaerotheca fuliginea, the causal agent of cucumber powdery mildew. These results suggest that strains of Lecanicillium spp. may have potential for development as a single microbial control agent effective against several plant diseases, pest insects and plant parasitic nematodes due to its antagonistic, parasitic and disease resistance inducing characteristics. However, to our knowledge, no Lecanicillium spp. have been developed for control of phytopathogens or phytoparasitic nematodes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Germin and germin-like proteins (GLPs) are encoded by a family of genes found in all plants. They are part of the cupin superfamily of biochemically diverse proteins, a superfamily that has a conserved tertiary structure, though with limited similarity in primary sequence. The subgroups of GLPs have different enzyme functions that include the two hydrogen peroxide-generating enzymes, oxalate oxidase (OxO) and superoxide dismutase. This review summarizes the sequence and structural details of GLPs and also discusses their evolutionary progression, particularly their amplification in gene number during the evolution of the land plants. In terms of function, the GLPs are known to be differentially expressed during specific periods of plant growth and development, a pattern of evolutionary subfunctionalization. They are also implicated in the response of plants to biotic (viruses, bacteria, mycorrhizae, fungi, insects, nematodes, and parasitic plants) and abiotic (salt, heat/cold, drought, nutrient, and metal) stress. Most detailed data come from studies of fungal pathogenesis in cereals. This involvement with the protection of plants from environmental stress of various types has led to numerous plant breeding studies that have found links between GLPs and QTLs for disease and stress resistance. In addition the OxO enzyme has considerable commercial significance, based principally on its use in the medical diagnosis of oxalate concentration in plasma and urine. Finally, this review provides information on the nutritional importance of these proteins in the human diet, as several members are known to be allergenic, a feature related to their thermal stability and evolutionary connection to the seed storage proteins, also members of the cupin superfamily.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) represents one of the most serious threats to predictable soybean yield in the United States. Originally discovered in North Carolina during 1954, intraspecific SCN population variability was soon noted. To reduce SCN crop damage, multiple agriculture techniques have been exploited. Of these, resistant varieties and rotation to non host crops have been the most effective in reducing the SCN egg population density. However, no single strategy is effective due to variation in SCN populations, lack of complete resistance, and economics of non host crop production. Although it is well accepted that dissimilarities in virulence phenotypes are not associated with any morphological distinctions, knowledge of biochemical characterization of SCN populations is lacking. Therefore, the protein profiles of eggs from four SCN populations were differentiated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Out of 25 protein bands ranging in molecular weight from 40 to 200 kDa, no differences were observed among any of the populations. These results suggest that eggs from SCN populations differing in virulence phenotypes have similar proteins at the resolution of SDS-PAGE.},

We screened the worldwide accession collection with the nematodes Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and M. hapla, soybean cyst nematode (SCN-Heterodera glycines), sugar beet cyst nematode (SBCN-Heterodera schachtii) and clover cyst nematode (CLCN-Heterodera trifolii), revealing resistant and susceptible accessions. In the over 100 accessions evaluated, we observed a range of responses to the root-knot nematode species, and a non-host response was observed for SCN and SBCN infection. However, variation was observed with respect to infection by CLCN. While many cultivars including Jemalong A17 were resistant to H. trifolli, cultivar Paraggio was highly susceptible. Identification of M. truncatula as a host for root-knot nematodes and IT trifolii and the differential host response to both RKN and CLCN provide the opportunity to genetically and molecularly characterize genes involved in plant-nematode interaction. Accession DZA045, obtained from an Algerian population, was resistant. to all three root-knot nematode species and was used for further studies. The mechanism of resistance in DZA045 appears different front Mi-mediated root-knot nematode resistance in tomato. Temporal analysis of nematode infection showed that there is no difference in nematode penetration between the resistant and susceptible accessions, and no hypersensitive response was observed in the resistant accession even several days after infection. However, less than 5% of the nematode population completed the life cycle as females in the resistant. accession. The remainder emigrated from the roots, kdeveloped its males, or died inside the roots as undeveloped larvae. Genetic analyses carried out by crossing DZA045 with a susceptible French accession, F83005, suggest that one gene controls resistance in DZA045.},

	Abstract = {Certain winter annual weeds have been documented as alternative hosts to soybean cyst nematode (SCN), and infestations of such species have become common in no-till production fields in the Midwest. This research was conducted to determine the influence of herbicide- and cover-crop-based winter annual weed management systems and crop rotation on winter annual weed growth and seed production, SCN population density, and crop yield. Two crop rotations (continuous soybean and soybean-corn) and six winter annual weed management systems (a nontreated control, fall and spring herbicide applications, spring-applied herbicide, fall-applied herbicide, fall-seeded annual ryegrass, and fall-seeded winter wheat) were evaluated in no-tillage systems from fall 2003 to 2006 at West Lafayette, IN and Vincennes, IN. Fall or spring herbicide treatments generally resulted in lower winter annual weed densities than cover crops. Densities of henbit and purple deadnettle increased over years in the cover crop systems but remained constant in the herbicide systems. Averaged over sites and years, winter annual weed densities were nearly 45% lower in the spring than the fall due to winter mortality. Corn yield was reduced by the cover crops at West Lafayette but not Vincennes. Winter annual weed management system had no influence on soybean yield. SCN population density was reduced by including corn in the crop sequence but was not influenced by winter annual weed management. The density of weedy host species of SCN in the experimental area was relatively low (less than 75 plants m(-2)) compared to densities that can be observed in production fields. The results of these experiments suggest that inclusion of corn into a cropping sequence is a much more valuable SCN management tool than winter annual weed management. In addition, control of winter annual weeds, specifically for SCN management, may not be warranted in fields with low weed density.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines is an obligate plant parasite capable of biochemically and developmentally altering its host's cells in order to create a specialized feeding cell. Although the exact mechanism of feeding cell morphogenesis remains a mystery, the nematode's ability to manipulate the plant is thought to be due in part to horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). A bioinformatic screen of the nematode genome has revealed homologues of the genes SNZ and SNO, which comprise a metabolic pathway for the de novo biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B-6 (VB6). Analysis of the 2 genes, HgSNZ and HgSNO, show that they contain nematode-like introns, generate polyadenylated mRNAs, and map to the soybean cyst nematode genetic linkage map, indicating that they are part of the nematode genome. However, gene synteny, protein homology, and phylogenetic evidence suggest prokaryotic origin. This would represent the first case of the HGT of a complete pathway into a nematode or terrestrial animal. VB6 acts as a cofactor in over 140 different enzymes, and recent studies point toward an important role as a potent quencher of reactive oxygen species. With H. glycines' penchant for acquiring parasitism genes through HGT along with the absence of this pathway in other land-based animals suggests a specific need for VB6 which may involve the parasite-host interaction.},

	Abstract = {The root knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, is an obligate parasite that causes significant damage to a broad range of host plants. Infection is associated with secretion of proteins surrounded by proliferating cells. Many parasites are known to secrete effectors that interfere with plant innate immunity, enabling infection to occur; they can also release pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, e. g., flagellin) that trigger basal immunity through the nematode stylet into the plant cell. This leads to suppression of innate immunity and reprogramming of plant cells to form a feeding structure containing multinucleate giant cells. Effectors have generally been discovered using genetics or bioinformatics, but M. incognita is nonsexual and its genome sequence has not yet been reported. To partially overcome these limitations, we have used mass spectrometry to directly identify 486 proteins secreted by M. incognita. These proteins contain at least segmental sequence identity to those found in our 3 reference databases (published nematode proteins; unpublished M. incognita ESTs; published plant proteins). Several secreted proteins are homologous to plant proteins, which they may mimic, and they contain domains that suggest known effector functions (e. g., regulating the plant cell cycle or growth). Others have regulatory domains that could reprogram cells. Using in situ hybridization we observed that most secreted proteins were produced by the subventral glands, but we found that phasmids also secreted proteins. We annotated the functions of the secreted proteins and classified them according to roles they may play in the development of root knot disease. Our results show that parasite secretomes can be partially characterized without cognate genomic DNA sequence. We observed that the M. incognita secretome overlaps the reported secretome of mammalian parasitic nematodes ( e. g., Brugia malayi), suggesting a common parasitic behavior and a possible conservation of function between metazoan parasites of plants and animals.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), is a damaging agricultural pest that could be effectively managed if critical phenotypes, such as virulence and host range could be understood. While SCN is amenable to genetic analysis, lack of DNA sequence data prevents the use of such methods to study this pathogen. Fortunately, new methods of DNA sequencing that produced large amounts of data and permit whole genome comparative analyses have become available. In this study, 400 million bases of genomic DNA sequence were collected from two inbred biotypes of SCN using 454 micro-bead DNA sequencing. Comparisons to a BAC, sequenced by Sanger sequencing, showed that the micro-bead sequences could identify low and high copy number regions within the BAC. Potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two SCN biotypes were identified by comparing the two sets of sequences. Selected resequencing revealed that up to 84% of the SNPs were correct. We conclude that the quality of the micro-bead sequence data was sufficient for de novo SNP identification and should be applicable to organisms with similar genome sizes and complexities. The SNPs identified will be an important starting point in associating phenotypes with specific regions of the SCN genome.},

From among four species tested on insects only H. nodulosa Petch infected about 20% of S. ratzeburgi larvae, whereas H. kirchneri (Rostrup) Minter, Brady et Hall, H. minnesotensis Chen, Liu et Chen, and H. rostrata Balazy et Wisniewski did not affect insect larvae. Only single eggs of the root-knot nematode were infected by H. minnesotensis in the laboratory trials, whereas its larvae remained unaffected. No infection cases of the potato cyst nematode (G. rostochiensis) and sugar beet nematode eggs were obtained. Comparisons of DNA-ITS-region sequences of the investigated strains with GenBank data showed no differences between H. minnesotensis isolates from the nematodes Heterodera glycines Ichinohe and from tarsonemid mites (authors' isolate). A fragment of ITS 2 with the sequence characteristic only for H. minnesotensis was selected. Two cluster analyses indicated close similarity of this species to H. thompsonii as sister clades, but the latter appeared more heterogenous. Insect and mite pathogenic species H. nodulosa localizes close to specialized aphid pathogen H. aphidis, whereas the phytophagous mite pathogens H. kirchneri and H. gregis form a separate sister clade. Hirsutella rostrata does not show remarkable relations to the establishment of aforementioned groups. Interrelated considerations on the morphology, biology and DNA sequencing of investigated Hirsutella species state their identification more precisely and facilitate the establishment of systematic positions.

Five groups of temporal patterns (A, B1, B2, C and D) were defined for the 24 genes plus data for two previously studied genes expressed in the same cell. Group D (two genes) showed no significant increase between 0 and 2 days pi and were the least abundantly expressed at 7-21 days pi. Transcripts of group C (nine genes including one Studied previously) increased in abundance from 0 to 2 days pi but were the second least expressed for 7-21 days pi. Groups A (three genes), B1 (seven genes) and B2 (five genes including one studied previously) were all abundant at 7-21 days pi. B1 and B2 were discriminated by their relative abundance at 0 and 2 days pi. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting two genes of group A and one each of B1 and B2 in nematodes prior to invasion resulted in phenotypic effects on total parasites per plant and sexual fate at 10 days pi. Phenotype penetrance was reduced for three genes showing such effects and one with a strong effect in earlier work when two genes rather than one were concurrently targeted for RNAi. One gene (dg13) was more abundantly expressed after combinatorial RNAi than for either control nematodes or when targeting singly by RNAi. This work reports the unexpected elevation in mRNA expression after combinatorial RNAi that requires understanding before combinatorial RNAi can be advanced for highly effective cyst nematode control via plant biotechnology.

After 3 weeks at 20 degrees C, 74 and 95% of the eggs within cysts and females, respectively, were colonised by the fungus on water agar. The full concentration of the fungal filtrate from cultures in malt extract broth killed only 12% of the juveniles after 24 h at 25 degrees C. In the greenhouse experiment, adding 16,000 chlamydospores of the fungus per gram of soil as either colonised barley grains or spores reduced the final number of females on roots of sugar beet by 50 and 66%, respectively, after 3 months. The reproduction factor was reduced to 2 in spore-treated soil compared with 5 in the untreated control, and 18% of the eggs in spore-treated soil were colonised by fungal mycelium. Generally, P. chlamydosporia var. chlamydosporia was more efficient at reducing the nematode population when applied as spores without any substrate than when used as colonised barley grains.},

Plants of each cultivar were individually inoculated with 1,000 eggs and vermiform Rotylenchulus reniformis nematodes. The reproduction factor (RF) and the number of R. reniformis/g of roots were calculated for each cultivar 60 days after inoculation. The cultivars BRSMG 250 [Nobreza], TMG115RR, TMG121RR, MGBR015849, TMG113RR, BRS Jiripoca, and M-SOY 833RR gave values of RF and number of nematodes/g root that did not differ statistically from those for the known resistant cultivar 'Custer'. Most of these cultivars are resistant to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) as well, indicating that the identification of cultivars that call be recommended as resistant to the reniform nematode would be accelerated by giving first priority to the evaluation of SCN-resistant cultivars.},

	Abstract = {Plants are hosts to a. wide array of pathogens from all kingdoms of life. In the absence of an active immune system or combinatorial diversifications that lead to recombination-driven somatic gene flexibility, plants have evolved different strategies to combat both individual pathogen strains and changing pathogen populations. The receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene-family expansion in plants was hypothesized to have allowed accelerated evolution among domains implicated in signal reception, typically a leucine-rich repeat (LRR). Under that model, the gene-family expansion represents a plant-specific adaptation that leads to the production of numerous and variable cell surface and cytoplasmic receptors.]Wore recently, it has emerged that the LRR domains of RLK interact with a diverse group of proteins leading to combinatorial variations in signal response specificity. Therefore, the RLK appear to play a central role in signaling during pathogen recognition, the subsequent activation of plant defense mechanisms, and developmental control. The future challenges will include determinations of RLK modes of action, the basis of recognition and specificity, which cellular responses each receptor mediates, and how both receptor and kinase domain interactions fit into the defense signaling cascades. These challenges will be complicated by the limited information that may be derived from the primary sequence of the LRR domain. The review focuses upon implications derived from recent studies of the secondary and tertiary structures of several plant RLK that change understanding of plant receptor function and signaling. In addition, the biological functions of plant and animal RLK-containing receptors were reviewed and commonalities among their signaling mechanisms identified. Further elucidated were the genomic and structural organizations of RLK gene families, with special emphasis on RLK implicated in resistance to disease and development.},

	Abstract = {Molecular markers have been widely used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). The QTL mapping partly relies on accurate linkage maps. The non-Mendelian segregation of markers, which affects not only the estimation of genetic distance between two markers but also the order of markers on a same linkage group, is usually observed in QTL analysis. However, these distorted markers are often ignored in the real data analysis of QTL mapping so that some important information may be lost. In this paper, we developed a multipoint approach via Hidden Markov chain model to reconstruct the linkage maps given a specified gene order while simultaneously making use of distorted, dominant and missing markers in an F2 population. The new method was compared with the methods in the MapManager and Mapmaker programs, respectively, and verified by a series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments along with a working example. Results showed that the adjusted linkage maps can be used for further QTL or segregation distortion locus (SDL) analysis unless there are strong evidences to prove that all markers show normal Mendelian segregation.},

NVS suppressed M. incognita. During year 1, increasing rates of NVS resulted in higher soil solution pH and greater M. incognita J2 and egg suppression. Soil solution pH remained higher in NVS-amended plots compared to the unamended control in years 2 and 3. NVS was more effective in reducing moderate than in reducing high initial nematode populations, with 94-100% reduction in egg and juvenile populations compared to 75-79%, respectively. In all experiments, a reduction in nematode populations by NVS, alone or in combination with a resistant cultivar, did not occur consistently in years 2 or 3. Unfortunately, the application rate of NVS required to achieve this reduction in nematode populations is probably not agronomically realistic. Additional research may allow the rate of NVS required to suppress plant-parasitic nematodes to be reduced.},

	Abstract = {Oriental mustard (Brassica juncea) bran, a by-product of mustard milling, and mustard seed meal were tested for their nematicidal activity on seven species of nematodes in the laboratory and on Pratylenchus penetrans on sweet corn in a greenhouse. The laboratory tests of mustard bran and mustard seed meal evaluated nematicidal toxicity and the effect of the two materials on hatching of cyst and root-knot nematode eggs. The most sensitive species to toxicity of mustard bran was Heterodera glycines, followed by Pratylenchus neglectus, Heterodera schachtii, Pratylenchus penetrans, Meloidogyne incognita and Meloidogyne hapla, with Caenorhabditis elegans the least sensitive; the same ranking applied to mustard seed meal toxicity. The effects of both materials at rates of 1,000 and 250 mu g/ml on hatching of cysts of cyst nematodes and-eggs of root-knot nematodes were variable: strong anti-hatching effect on M. incognita; almost no effect on M. hapla; stimulating effect on cysts of H. schachtii at the low rate; anti-hatching at the high rate and anti-hatching effect on H. glycines at the high rate. The nematicidal activity of mustard bran and seed meal against P penetrans on sweet corn and the phytotoxicity on potato, strawberry and sweet corn were tested in the greenhouse. At rates of 0.1% and 0.05% (w/w), both materials were toxic to R penetrans on sweet corn, as shown by reduction of nematode populations in soil and roots. The bran material at rates 0.3% (w/w) or higher reduced the fresh and dried weights of shoots and roots of potato, strawberry and sweet corn; seed meal at rates of 0.1% (w/w) or higher had a similar phytotoxic effect on these crops.

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: Understanding how interactions among set of genes affect diverse phenotypes is having a greater impact on biomedical research, agriculture and evolutionary biology. Mapping and characterizing the isolated effects of single quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a first step, but we also need to assemble networks of QTLs and define non-additive interactions (epistasis) together with a host of potential environmental modulators. In this article, we present a full-QTL model with which to explore the genetic architecture of complex trait in multiple environments. Our model includes the effects of multiple QTLs, epistasis, QTL-by-environment interactions and epistasis-by-environment interactions. A new mapping strategy, including marker interval selection, detection of marker interval interactions and genome scans, is used to evaluate putative locations of multiple QTLs and their interactions. All the mapping procedures are performed in the framework of mixed linear model that are flexible to model environmental factors regardless of fix or random effects being assumed. An F-statistic based on Henderson method III is used for hypothesis tests. This method is less computationally greedy than corresponding likelihood ratio test. In each of the mapping procedures, permutation testing is exploited to control for genome-wide false positive rate, and model selection is used to reduce ghost peaks in F-statistic profile. Parameters of the full-QTL model are estimated using a Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling. Monte Carlo simulations help define the reliability and efficiency of the method. Two real-world phenotypes (BXD mouse olfactory bulb weight data and rice yield data) are used as exemplars to demonstrate our methods.

H. vermicola had no or weak parasitism on the six assayed nematode species. The phylogenetic trees of ITS region, MAPK gene fragments and their combination revealed that there was genetic variability among species and isolates, but there was no apparent relationship between the genetic variability and their host or geographic origin.

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) is the primary disease responsible for yield loss of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Resistant cultivars are an effective management tool; however, the sources currently available have common resistant genes. Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc., the wild ancestor of domesticated soybean, represents a diverse germplasm pool with known SCN resistance. The objectives of this research were to: (1) determine the genetic variation and inheritance of SCN resistance in a G. max ('S08-80') G. soja (PI464925B) F (4:5) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population; and (2) identify and evaluate quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with SCN resistance. Transgressive segregation for resistance was observed, although neither parent was resistant to the Chatham and Ruthven SCN isolates. Broad sense heritability was 0.81 for the Ruthven and 0.91 for the Chatham isolate. Root dry weight was a significant covariate that influenced cyst counts. One RIL [female index (FI) = 5.2 +/- 1.11] was identified as resistant to the Chatham isolate (FI < 10). Seventeen and three RILs infected with Chatham and Ruthven isolates, respectively, had mean adjusted cyst counts of zero. Unique and novel QTL, which derived resistance from G. soja, were identified on linkage groups I, K, and O, and individually explained 8, 7 and 5% (LOD = 2.1-2.7) of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. Significant epistatic interactions were found between pairs of SSR markers that individually may or may not have been associated with SCN resistance, which explained between 10 and 15% of the total phenotypic variation. Best-fit regression models explained 21 and 31% of the total phenotypic variation in the RIL population to the Chatham and Ruthven isolates, respectively. The results of this study help to improve the understanding of the genetic control of SCN resistance in soybean caused by minor genes resulting in horizontal resistance. The incorporation of the novel resistance QTL from G. soja could increase the durability of SCN-resistance in soybean cultivars, especially if major gene resistance breaks down.},

	Abstract = {Meiotic recombination is almost universal among sexually reproducing organisms. Because the process leads to the destruction of successful parental allele combinations and the creation of novel, untested genotypes for offspring, the evolutionary forces responsible for the origin and maintenance of this counter-intuitive process are still enigmatic. Here, we have used newly available genetic data to compare genome-wide recombination rates in a report on recombination rates among different taxa. In particular, we find that among the higher eukaryotes exceptionally high rates are found in social Hymenoptera. The high rates are compatible with current hypotheses suggesting that sociality in insects strongly selects for increased genotypic diversity in worker offspring to either meet the demands of a sophisticated caste system or to mitigate against the effects of parasitism. Our findings might stimulate more detailed research for the comparative study of recombination frequencies in taxa with different life histories or ecological settings and so help to understand the causes for the evolution and maintenance of this puzzling process.},

Differences in cotton height could not be detected among common cocklebur densities or nematode presence at 3 wk after transplanting (WAT); however, differences in crop height were observed at 5 WAT between nematode treatments. In the absence of nematodes, the relationship between cotton yield loss and common cocklebur density was described by a rectangular hyperbolic regression model (P < 0.0001). Maximum yield loss from common cocklebur in the absence of nematodes exceeded 80%. In the presence of nematodes, there was a linear relationship between cotton yield loss and common cocklebur density (P = 0.0506). The presence of nematodes at each common cocklebur density increased cotton yield loss 15 to 35%. Common cocklebur plant biomass was 25% greater in nematode treatments, likely because of the reduced competitiveness of the cotton plants in these plots. This study demonstrates that multiple pests can interact to cause an additive reduction in crop yield.},

	Abstract = {A new venom allergen-like protein gene isolated from Meloidogyne incognita (designated Mi-vap-2) was cloned and analysed. The genomic clone of Mi-vap-2 is 1917-bp long, contains three introns, which range in size from 39 to 797 bp, and four exons ranging in size from 37 to 361 bp. The cDNA of Mi-vap-2 contains an open reading frame encoding 294 amino acids, being the first 16 residues a putative secretion signal. Southern blot analysis suggested that Mi-vp-2 is probably a member of a small multigene family. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the transcripts of Mi-vap-2 accumulated exclusively within the subventral oesophageal gland cells of M. incognita. RT-PCR analyses confirmed that Mi-vap-2 was transcribed mainly in the pre-parasitic second-stage and early post-inoculated juveniles. Results indicated that this venom allergen-like protein gene may play an important role in establishment of the parasitic relationship between plants and nematodes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {A pot experiment to determine the effects of summer cover crops and soil amendments on okra yields and population densities of various soil nematode taxa was conducted in two consecutive growing seasons in a subtropical region. Two cover crops, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and sorghum sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. bicolor var. sudanense), were grown and returned to the soil with fallow as a control. As soon as these cover crops were harvested, they were soil-incorporated together with one of several organic amendments. These organic amendments were biosolids, N-Viro soil (a 1 : 1 mixture of coal ash and biosolids), coal ash, co-compost (a 3 : 7 mixture of biosolids and yard wastes), and yard waste compost compared with a control (no additional amendment). Other treatments were fumigation with MC-33 (a mixture of 33% of methyl bromide and 67% of chloropicrin) and cover crop removal (harvested and removed cover crops and their residues from the soil). A nematode-susceptible vegetable crop, okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.), was grown under these treatments. Among organic amendments, the application of biosolids produced the highest okra yield and biomass, and greatly suppressed root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne incognita, in the soil. Between these two cover crops, sunn hemp was superior to sorghum sudangrass in improving okra production and in suppressing root-knot nematodes. The result indicates that growing sunn hemp as a cover crop and applying certain organic amendments can improve okra production and suppress root-knot nematodes, which are very damaging to okra plants. Such combined practices show a significant potential for application in organic farming and sustainable agriculture systems in a tropical or subtropical region.},

An extracellular protease (Hnsp) was detected in liquid culture of Hirsutella rhossiliensis OWVT-1 with nematodes (Panagrellus redivivus) as the unique nitrogen source and purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Its molecular mass was about 32 kDa, and the optimal reaction pH value and temperature were pH 7 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The Hnsp activity was stable at pH 6-8 and decreased radically at 50 degrees C for 10 min. Hnsp was highly sensitive to inhibitor of PMSF and well decomposed the substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, suggesting that it belonged to the chymotrypsin/subtilisin of serine proteases. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Hnsp was SVTDQQGADCGLARISHRE, which showed high homology with other serine proteases from nematophagous fungi. Ability to kill nematode and degrade its cuticle in vitro indicated that Hnsp could be involved in the infection of nematode.},

B-3 isolate showed the high rate of parasitism on Meloidogyne incognita eggs with more than 90% infection rate on the third day after treatment. B-3 crude chitinase damaged the eggshell structures more than 78% based on lactoglycerol staining data at a final protein concentration of 14.6 mu g mL(-1) on the fourth day following treatment. Partially purified chitinase with molecular 37 kDa from DEAE-Sephadex chromatography also showed damaging effect on the eggs. These results suggested that chitinase from B-3 isolate was responsible for degradation of M. incognita eggshell structures.},

	Abstract = {Changes in transcript accumulation for cell wall-modifying proteins were examined in excised soybean root pieces colonized by soybean cyst nematodes (SCN), Heterodera glycines, using RT-PCR and soybean Affymetrix GeneChips. Sequence-specific PCR primer pairs were prepared from sequence data for core sequences in the GenBank soybean database and consensus sequences derived from the assembly of soybean ESTs. In addition, to identify previously uncharacterized soybean transcripts, degenerate primers were prepared for conserved motifs in cellulases (endo-1,4-beta-glucanases, EGases) and polygalacturonases (PGs) and these were used to amplify segments of transcripts that were then extended with 3' and 5' RACE. Several novel EGase and PG transcripts were identified. Gene expression patterns were determined by real-time RT-PCR for 11 EGases, three expansins (EXPs), 14 PGs, two pectate lyases (PLs), and two xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) in soybean roots inoculated with SCN, non-inoculated roots, serial dissections of root tips, leaf abscission zones, flowers, apical buds, and expanding leaves. A large number of genes associated with cell wall modifications are strongly up-regulated in root pieces colonized by SCN. However, in contrast to most of the transcripts for cell wall proteins, two XTH transcripts were specifically down-regulated in the colonized root pieces. Gene expression in serial dissections of root tips (0-2 mm, and 2-7 mm) and whole roots indicate that the SCN up-regulated genes are associated with a wide range of developmental processes in roots. Also of interest, many of the cDNAs examined were up-regulated in petiole abscission zones induced to abscise with ethylene.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into an organism to induce sequence-specific RNA interference (RNAi) of a target transcript has become a powerful technique to investigate gene function in nematodes and many organisms. Data provided here indicate that the inclusion of 1-2 mM spermidine and 50 mM octopamine and a 24 hr incubation period of nematodes in double-standard RNA (dsRNA) soaking solutions resulted in a considerable increase in the percentage of nematodes that ingested dsRNA as compared to previous reports. This modified dsRNA soaking method was coupled with quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses to assess the potential silencing of the Heterodera glycines parasitism gene transcripts Hg pel-I and Hg-4E02 that are expressed within the esophageal gland cells of preparasitic H. glycines J2. The Hg-pel-I transcript was most efficiently silenced with one dsRNA construct (ds267) at the highest dsRNA soaking concentration of 5.0 mg/ml, while the Hg-4E02 transcript was more efficiently silenced at the 2.5 mg/ml dsRNA concentration as compared to 5.0 mg/ml. A dsRNA construct (ds285) complementary to a different sequence within the Hg-pel-I transcript than construct ds267 induced only minimal silencing of the Hg-pel-I transcript at 2.5 mg/ml. The results suggest that both dsRNA concentration and sequence relative to the transcript targeted are critical for maximizing potential RNAi effects in parasitic nematodes.},

The experimental design was a randomized block split-plot with eight replications. The main plots were crop rotations (continuous cotton, continuous corn, corn-cotton-corn-cotton, or cotton-corn-corn-cotton), and six-row subplots were one of four genotypes of either corn or cotton. Nematode populations in the center two rows of each subplot were determined at planting, midseason, and harvest. Cotton and corn yields were determined from samples taken from one or all four of the inner subplot rows, respectively. In plots planted to cotton the previous season, nematode populations at planting exceeded damaging levels for Mississippi, regardless of rotation sequence. Nematode populations remained below damaging levels throughout the season in cotton following two seasons of corn. However, when cotton followed one season of corn, nematode populations rebounded to damaging levels by the end of the season. Cotton lint yield from the cotton-corn-corn-cotton rotation was 194 kg/ha greater than yield from the continuous cotton plots in 2003. At the nematode population levels in this study, a rotation with at least two consecutive years of corn appears to be necessary to achieve reniform nematode suppression sufficient to increase cotton yield. Corn yields were either not affected or, in one year, improved when the crop was grown in rotation with cotton. Crop genotype did not affect reniform nematode population density, and there were no genotype x rotation interactions with respect to either reniform nematode population density or crop yield.},

A reduction in gene transcript was observed and the number of nematodes infecting plants was reduced by almost 60% as was the number of established females producing eggs at 21 days post-infection. The cysteine protemase activity of M. incognita, reported by the substrate GLUpNA, was inhibited by the cysteine protemase inhibitor Oc-I Delta D86. A reduction in cysteine protemase activity was also seen following RNAi of Mi-cpl-1 in J2 stage nematodes. In situ hybridization analysis in young and mature female nematodes has shown that Mi-cpl-1 is expressed in the intestine, which suggests that its product is a digestive enzyme. The effects of knocking-out Mi-cpl-1 gene function were consistent with a reduction in feeding efficiency. Here, we have shown a correlation between transcript abundance protemase activity and parasitic success of M. incognita. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Soil pH measured to a 15-cm depth across fields ranged from 5.6 to 8.2 and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) ranged from 0 to 30%. Soil CCE varied from 2.5 to 30% as pH ranged from 7.7 to 8.2. Grain yield decreased with increasing pH and CCE in 9 and 11 fields, respectively. Soil pH and CCE explained 30 and 41 % of the variability in relative yield across sites, respectively. An alkalinity stress index (ASI) that combined both measurements (pH + 0.14CCE) was developed based on the relative effects of each measurement on yield and explained 45% of the yield variability across sites. The index developed was a better predictor of soybean yield in fields with high-pH soils than each measurement alone.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is currently the most devastating pathogen of soybean. SCN penetrates the root and migrates toward the central vascular bundle where it establishes a complex multinucleated feeding structure that provides plant-derived nutrients to support the development and growth of the nematode. To identify host genes that play significant roles in SCN development in susceptible roots, RNA from SCN-inoculated and non-inoculated root pieces were hybridized to the Affymetrix soybean genome GeneChips. RNA was collected at 8, 12, and 16 d post-inoculation from root pieces that displayed multiple swollen female SCN and similar root pieces from non-inoculated roots. Branch roots and root tips were trimmed from the root pieces to minimize the amount of RNA contributed by these organs. Of the 35 593 transcripts represented on the GeneChip, approximately 26 500 were expressed in the SCN-colonized root pieces. ANOVA followed by False Discovery Rate analysis indicated that the expression levels of 4616 transcripts changed significantly (Q-value 2-fold and 739 decreased > 2-fold. Of the transcripts to which a function could be assigned, a large proportion was associated with cell wall structure. Other functional categories that included a large number of up-regulated transcripts were defence, metabolism, and histones, and a smaller group of transcripts associated with signal transduction and transcription.},

Homogenates of cyst walls or rinsates of either cyst walls or eggs each significantly increased hatch of juveniles five-fold compared with sterile distilled water controls. Cyst or egg homogenates induced significant increases (7.7-9.0-fold) in hatch of juveniles compared with controls. These values represent approximately 24.8-29.0% of the 31-fold induction of hatch of juveniles by potato root diffusate, routinely used to stimulate hatch in G. rostochiensis. The hatch inducing factor(s) in cyst homogenates was thermostable and retained activity after repeated freezing and thawing. Filter fractionation of cyst homogenate localised activity between molecular mass 0.5 kDa and 5 kDa, with no hatch inducing activity present above 5 kDa. Apparent depression of hatch induction at high concentrations of non-fractionated cyst homogenates suggests the presence of hatch inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, is a serious economic threat to soybean producers in Missouri. Periodic monitoring for the presence, population densities, and virulence phenotypes of H. glycines is essential for determining crop losses and devising management strategies implementing the use of resistant cultivars. A survey using area-frame sampling was conducted to determine the distribution and virulence phenotypes of H. glycines in Missouri during 2005. Two samples from each of 125 fields representing eight geographical regions of Missouri were collected; 243 samples were processed for extraction of cysts and eggs. In all, 49% of samples had detectable cyst nematode populations, which ranged from 138 to 85,250 eggs per 250 cm(3) of soil. Race and H. glycines type tests were conducted on populations from 45 samples. Nearly 80% of the populations that were tested, irrespective of the region, were virulent on the indicator line plant introduction (PI) 88788, which is the source of resistance for most H. glycines-resistant cultivars. More than 70% of populations could reproduce on the indicator lines PI 88788, PI 209332, and PI 548316 (Cloud), indicating that soybean cultivars with resistance derived from these sources need to be carefully monitored and used only in rotation with nonhost crops and soybean cultivars with resistance from other sources. Approximately one-third of the populations, primarily in the southern regions of Missouri, could reproduce on PI 548402 (Peking), another common source of resistance. Fewer than 10% of the populations could reproduce on PI 90763, PI 437654, PI 89772, or PI 438489B, suggesting that these sources of resistance should be used in soybean breeding programs to develop H. glycines-resistant soybean cultivars.},

Hirsutella minnesotensis reduced nematode densities by 31-83% across nematode populations in one test, but only slightly reduced densities of NYG and CT populations in another test. NVS reduced nematode densities by 33-92% across populations in two repeated tests. The combination of the two agents resulted in greater nematode reduction compared with Hm alone, but not compared with NVS alone. Across all Hm and NVS treatments, reduction of nematode densities were generally greater in NYG, CT, and RI than in MI and NYL populations. This study demonstrated that Hm and NVS may be used to suppress different M. hapla populations.},

	Abstract = {Charcoal rot [Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Gold] of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a disease of economic significance throughout the world. Progress in developing resistant genotypes has been hampered because of a lack of reliable and efficient methods for assessment of soybean genotypes. Researchers need a common system for classifying soybean genotypes for their reaction to M. phaseolina that is consistent across environments. We propose a classification system based on a colony-forming unit index (CFUI), derived by dividing the colony-forming unit (CFU) value of a given genotype by the CFU value of a susceptible standard. Four other assessment methods were compared and correlated to CFUI: percent height of stem discoloration measured at R7, foliar symptoms taken at R7, area under the disease progress curve based on foliar symptom data collected four times during the growing season up to R7, and the intensity of internal root and stem discoloration taken at R7 (root and stem severity [RSS]). Twenty-four soybean genotypes in Maturity Groups III through V were evaluated in 2002 and 2003 in naturally and artificially infested fields. Based on the CFUI, four genotypes were classified as moderately resistant to M. phaseolina. Among the disease assessment methods, RSS had the highest correlation with CFUI (r = 0.71 in 2002 and r = 0.69 in 2003). The CFUI provided a good measure of disease resistance across environments but was still time consuming. The RSS provided a less-accurate but more-rapid alternative that may be suitable for some breeding strategies.},

	Abstract = {The pending loss of methyl bromide (MBr) and less understood nematode adaptation behaviour present significant challenges in managing Meloidogyne hapla in vegetable and nursery industries in temperate climates. This study examined the reproductive potential of populations of M. hapla from three nursery (Fields 1-3), one vegetable (Field 4) production system, and their response to a nutrition-based N-Viro Soil (R) (N-VS, recycled municipal biosolid) amendment. Fields 1, 2, 3, and 4 had loamy sand, sandy, sandy, and muck soils with pHs of 7.15, 6.56, 7.43, and 6.30, respectively. The muck soil, never treated with MBr, had two-three times more nitrogen than the nursery fields. Measured by nematode community structure ecological indices, the muck soil had better nutrient availability and energy channels than loamy sand soil. In repeated experiments, the four M. hapla fields and a glasshouse (control) population were subjected to 0, 1, or 4g NVS 100cm(-3). of sandy loam soil using tomato at 28 +/- 2 degrees C for 504 +/- 56 degree-days. While both NVS doses significantly reduced population densities of all populations compared with the controls, the high dose was more suppressive than the low dose. Within the NVS-free controls, the population from muck soil had the lowest reproductive potential, which, in turn, was positively correlated with the soil pH from where the nematodes came. Difference in reproductive potential between the nursery and the muck soil populations suggests-that nematode adaptation may need to be considered in identifying and in managing populations of M. hapla. Hence, understanding if and how MBr use and soil pH and nitrogen may affect nematode adaptation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The objective of this 2-year study was to test if standard at-planting application of 112.09 kg(-1) ha(-1) of 06-15-40 (N-P-K) containing urea (+N), or 0-15-40 (N-P-K) (-N) or a no fertiliser check (0) affect yield of SCN resistant ('Jack') and two susceptible ('CX 252' and 'Kenwood-94') soybean cultivars under high and low SCN and other soil abiotic stresses. Yield was higher under low compared to high stress during both years, with Jack producing the highest yield and Kenwood-94 the lowest. While not statistically significant, +N tended to decrease nodulation and increase yield under low stress in all cultivars. Nodulation was correlated positively with yield and negatively with daily nematode population density (DNPD), suggesting potential problems for N supply under nematode infestation. The susceptible cultivars accumulated significantly more leaf Ca and Mg than Jack, which was more pronounced in the presence of high rather than low stress, confirming known responses to stress. At high stress, only CX 252 showed a yield increase in response to N treatment, suggesting possible physiological adaptation mechanisms. Future research that account for the relationships amongst DNPD, frequency of sampling, and host response to better understand confounding factors and to conclusively prove or disprove any benefits from supplementary N under SCN infestation are discussed.},

Thirty T-0 lines that successfully expressed the Hs1(pro-1) gene, as indicated by both polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction analyses, were generated. Bioassay of the T-1 progeny from these lines revealed that only five T-0 lines grew normally and exhibited a high degree of SCN resistance. On average, these T-1 transgenic progeny were about 70% more resistant to SCN than susceptible control cultivars. These preliminary data suggest that Hs1(pro-1) is a promising candidate for genetically engineering SCN resistance in elite, locally adapted soybean cultivars.},

	Abstract = {Ethylene-responsive element-binding proteins (EREBPs) are plant-specific transcription factors, many of which have been linked to plant defense responses. Conserved EREBP domains bind to the GCC box, a promoter element found in pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. We previously identified an EREBP gene from soybean (GmEREBP1) whose transcript abundance decreased in soybean cyst-nematode-infected roots of a susceptible cultivar, whereas it increased in abundance in infected roots of a resistant cultivar. Here, we report further characterization of this gene. Transient expression analyses showed that GmEREBP1 is localized to the plant nucleus and functions as a transcriptional activator in soybean leaves. Transgenic soybean plants expressing GmEREBP1 activated the expression of the ethylene (ET)responsive gene PR2 and the ET- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene PR3, and the salicyllic acid (SA)-responsive gene PR1 but not the SA-responsive PR5. Similarly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GinEREBP1 showed elevated mRNA abundance of the ET-regulated gene PR3 and the ET- and JA-regulated defense-related gene PDF1.2 but not the ET-regulated GST2, and the SA-regulated gene PR1 but not the SA-regulated PR2 and PR5. Transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis plants inoculated with cyst nematodes did not display a significantly altered susceptibility to nematode infection. These results collectively show that GmEREBP1 functions as a transacting inducer of defense gene expression in both soybean and Arabidopsis and mediates the expression of both ET-and JA- and SA-regulated defense-related genes in these plant species.},

Movement frequency in both species was increased by 50-70% (P < 0.0001) by 50 mM octopamine, and 5 mM octopamine increased M. incognita movement frequency more than twofold (P < 0.0001). Movement frequency in each species was reduced by more than 90% by 5 mM serotonin (P < 0.0001). While amplitude of body movement in H. glycines was unaffected by any amine, it was significantly reduced in M. incognita by all amines (P < 0.0006).

Although AFLP data provided enough resolution to distinguish H. schachtii populations on a large geographical scale, sequencing of ITS rDNA gene variants did not provide any grouping according to geographical origin or taxonomy. A close relationship between H. schachtii and H. betae was observed with both techniques used in this Study.},

	Abstract = {Soybean hairy roots, transformed with the soybean chalcone synthase (CHS6) or isoflavone synthase (IFS2) genes, with dramatically decreased capacity to synthesize isoflavones were produced to determine what effects these changes would have on susceptibility to a fungal pathogen. The isoflavone and coumestrol concentrations were decreased by about 90% in most lines apparently due to gene silencing. The IFS2 transformed lines had very low IFS enzyme activity in microsomal fractions as measured by the conversion of naringenin to genistein. The CHS6 lines with decreased isoflavone concentrations had 5 to 20-fold lower CHS enzyme activities than the appropriate controls. Both IFS2 and CHS transformed lines accumulated higher concentrations of both soluble and cell wall bound phenolic acids compared to controls with higher levels found in the CHS6 lines indicating alterations in the lignin biosynthetic branch of the pathway. Induction of the soybean phytoalexin glyceollin, of which the precursor is the isoflavone daidzein, by the fungal pathogen Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines (FSG) that causes soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) showed that the low isoflavone transformed lines did not accumulate glyceollin while the control lines did. The (iso)liquritigenin content increased upon FSG induction in the IFS2 transformed roots indicating that the pathway reactions before this point can control isoflavonoid synthesis. The lowest fungal growth rate on hairy roots was found on the FSG partially resistant control roots followed by the SDS sensitive control roots and the low isoflavone transformants. The results indicate the importance of phytoalexin synthesis in root resistance to the pathogen.},

	Abstract = {Many isolates of the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne hapla reproduce by facultative meiotic parthenogenesis. Sexual crosses can occur, but, in the absence of males, the diploid state appears to be restored by reuniting sister chromosomes of a single meiosis. We have crossed inbred strains of M. hapla, that differ in DNA markers and produced hybrids and F-2 lines. Here we show that heterozygous M. hapla females, upon parthenogenetic reproduction, produce progeny that segregate 1:1 for the presence or absence of dominant DNA markers, as would be expected if sister chromosomes are rejoined, rather than the 3:1 ratio typical of a Mendelian cross. Codominant markers also segregate 1:1 and heterozygotes are present at low frequency (< 3%). Segregation patterns and recombinant analysis indicate that a homozygous condition is prevalent for markers flanking recombination events, suggesting that recombination occurs preferentially as four-strand exchanges at similar locations between both pairs of non-sister chromatids. With this mechanism, meiotic parthenogenesis would be expected to result in rapid genomic homozygosity. This type of high negative crossover interference coupled with positive chromatid interference has not been observed in fungal or other animal systems in which it is possible to examine the sister products of a single meiosis and may indicate that meiotic recombination in this nematode has novel features.},

	Abstract = {Nacobbus aberrans produces severe damage to agriculture and is considered to be of quarantine importance. The levels of polymorphism and genetic differentiation among Argentine populations of this species from different hosts and origin were studied using Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) as molecular markers. Second-stage juveniles from nine populations associated with three different hosts (tomato, quinoa and potato) were analysed individually. Three primers were selected because they produced clear and 100% reproducible patterns; 37 fragments were considered for the analysis. The technique employed revealed high levels of polymorphisms, the highest proportion of genetic diversity being found within populations (95%). Populations showed a tendency to group together according to their original host, based on their pairwise F-ST. Low levels of genetic differentiation among populations were observed, suggesting an extensive gene flow among them. Passive dispersal of nematodes by natural means and anthropogenic activities would probably be, at least partially, responsible for the results observed. This work is the first study of genetic structure of N. aberrans populations at a macrogeographical level using ISSR markers.},

	Abstract = {The cell wall, a strong extraprotoplasmic layer surrounding plant cells that mainly consists of a variety of polysaccharides, constitutes a major barrier for potential parasites. Plant-parasitic nematodes are well equipped to overcome this barrier as they produce and secrete cell-wall-degrading enzymes. Expression profiling of various life stages of the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis revealed a novel pectate lyase gene (Gr-pel2, 759 bp). The Gr-PEL2 protein showed highest similarity to pectate lyases from the facultative plant-parasitic nematodes Bursaphelenchus mucronatus and B. xylophilus and the soil-inhabiting saprophytic Streptomyces and Frankia species (i.e. 40-42% identity and 58-60% similarity), whereas only a remote relatedness to the previously identified Gr-PEL1 was observed (i.e. 28% identity and 43% similarity). Transient expression of Gr-pel2 in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in severe malformations of the infiltrated tissues, not relating to maceration and soft rot symptoms. Ca2+ is known to be essential for pectate lyase activity, and the most likely calcium-binding site was identified in the Gr-PEL2 protein by combining homology modelling of the three-dimensional structure, site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression in leaves. A highly charged cleft in Gr-PEL2, which is likely to be involved in substrate binding and which is also significantly more hydrophobic in Gr-PEL1, was shown to be essential for protein activity. Our results underline the broad spectrum of pectate lyases and cell-wall-degrading enzymes necessary for successful parasitism by cyst nematodes.},

	Abstract = {Syncytial cells in soybean (Glycine max cultivar [cv.] Peking) roots infected by incompatible and compatible populations of soybean cyst nematode (SCN [Heterodera glycines]) were collected using laser capture microdissection (LCM). Gene transcript abundance was assayed using Affymetrix((R)) soybean GeneChips((R)), each containing 37,744 probe sets. Our analyses identified differentially expressed genes in syncytial cells that are not differentially expressed in the whole root analyses. Therefore, our results show that the mass of transcriptional activity occurring in the whole root is obscuring identification of transcriptional events occurring within syncytial cells. In syncytial cells from incompatible roots at three dpi, genes encoding lipoxygenase (LOX), heat shock protein (HSP) 70, superoxidase dismutase (SOD) were elevated almost tenfold or more, while genes encoding several transcription factors and DNA binding proteins were also elevated, albeit at lower levels. In syncytial cells formed during the compatible interaction at three dpi, genes encoding prohibitin, the epsilon chain of ATP synthase, allene oxide cyclase and annexin were more abundant. By 8 days, several genes of unknown function and genes encoding a germin-like protein, peroxidase, LOX, GAPDH, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptolosonate 7-phosphate synthase, ATP synthase and a thioesterase were abundantly expressed. These observations suggest that gene expression is different in syncytial cells as compared to whole roots infected with nematodes. Our observations also show that gene expression is different between syncytial cells that were isolated from incompatible and compatible roots and that gene expression is changing over the course of syncytial cell development as it matures into a functional feeding site.},

Peking] roots by incompatible (I) and compatible (C) populations of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines) was assayed using an Affymetrix((R)) soybean GeneChip((R)). This time-course microarray analysis, using 37,744 probe sets, measured transcript abundance during I and C. These analyses reveal that infection by individual I and C H. glycines populations influence the transcription of G. max genes differently. A substantial difference in gene expression is present between I and C at 12 h post infection. Thus, G. max can differentiate between I and C nematode populations even before they have begun to select their feeding sites. The microarray analysis identified genes induced earlier in infection during I than C. MA also identified amplitude differences in transcript abundance between I and C reactions. Some of the probe sets measuring increased transcript levels during I represented no apical meristem (NAM) and WRKY transcription factors as well as NBS-LRR kinases. Later during I, heat shock protein (HSPs) probe sets (i.e. HSP90, HSP70, ClpB/HSP101) measured increased transcript abundance. These results demonstrate that G. max roots respond very differently to the different H. glycines races even before their feeding site selection has occurred. The ability of G. max to engage an I reaction, thus, appears to be dependent on the ability of root cells to recognize the different races of H. glycines because these experiments were conducted in the identical G. max genetic background.},

	Abstract = {Background: Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode [SCN]), the major pathogen of Glycine max (soybean), undergoes muscle degradation (sarcopenia) as it becomes sedentary inside the root. Many genes encoding muscular and neuromuscular components belong to the uncoordinated (unc) family of genes originally identified in Caenorhabditis elegans. Previously, we reported a substantial decrease in transcript abundance for Hg-unc-87, the H. glycines homolog of unc-87 (calponin) during the adult sedentary phase of SCN. These observations implied that changes in the expression of specific muscle genes occurred during sarcopenia. Results: We developed a bioinformatics database that compares expressed sequence tag (est) and genomic data of C. elegans and H. glycines (CeHg database). We identify H. glycines homologs of C. elegans unc genes whose protein products are involved in muscle composition and regulation. RT-PCR reveals the transcript abundance of H. glycines unc homologs at mobile and sedentary stages of its lifecycle. A prominent reduction in transcript abundance occurs in samples from sedentary nematodes for homologs of actin, unc-60B (cofilin), unc-89, unc-15 (paromyosin), unc-27 (troponin 1), unc-54 (myosin), and the potassium channel unc-110 (twk-18). Less reduction is observed for the focal adhesion complex gene Hg-unc-97. Conclusion: The CeHg bioinformatics database is shown to be useful in identifying homologs of genes whose protein products perform roles in specific aspects of H. glycines muscle biology. Our bioinformatics comparison of C. elegans and H. glycines genomic data and our Hg-unc-87 expression experiments demonstrate that the transcript abundance of specific H. glycines homologs of muscle gene decreases as the nematode becomes sedentary inside the root during its parasitic feeding stages.},

	Abstract = {Corn and soybean growers across Indiana were surveyed to assess their perceptions about the importance of preplant and POST weed control timing, focusing mainly on soybean production. Despite studies demonstrating the importance of planting into a clean field, almost a third of Indiana growers do not think it is important to plant into a weed-free seedbed and 74% do not use residual herbicides in glyphosate-resistant soybean production systems. Growers who farmed less than 200 ha were more likely to overestimate the ability of soybean to tolerate weed interference than growers who farmed more hectares. Growers who manage smaller farms were also more likely to use a one-pass weed control program than larger growers. This suggests that yield losses to weed interference may be greater for smaller farms than for larger farms. Weed size and density were the most common criteria used by growers to decide when to apply herbicides. This suggests that field scouting plays an important role in the decision-making process of growers. However, a substantial proportion of growers apply POST herbicides to large common lambsquarters and giant ragweed in an attempt to minimize the number of trips across the field for weed control. Delayed control of these species likely contributes to reduced crop yields, higher application rates, and to the survival of treated plants. Opportunities to improve control and increase yields through more optimal herbicide use appear possible for Indiana corn and soybean growers.},

	Abstract = {Cyst nematodes of the genus Heterodera are obligate, sedentary endoparasites that have developed highly evolved relationships with specific host plant species. Successful parasitism involves significant physiological and morphological changes to plant root cells for the formation of specialized feeding cells called syncytia. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of nematode feeding cells, transcript profiling was conducted on developing syncytia induced by the soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines in soybean roots by coupling laser capture microdissection with high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis. This approach has identified pathways that may play intrinsic roles in syncytium induction, formation, and function. Our data suggest interplay among phytohormones that likely regulates synchronized changes in the expression of genes encoding cell-wall-modifying proteins. This process appears to be tightly controlled and coordinately regulated with cell wall rigidification processes that may involve lignification of feeding cell walls. Our data also show local downregulation of jasmonic acid biosynthesis and responses in developing syncytia, which suggest a local suppression of plant defense mechanisms. Moreover, we identified genes encoding putative transcription factors and components of signal transduction pathways that may be important in the regulatory processes governing syncytium formation and function. Our analysis provides a broad mechanistic picture that forms the basis for future hypothesis-driven research to understand cyst nematode parasitism and to develop effective management tools against these pathogens.},

These included genes encoding enzymes involved in primary metabolism; biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, lignin, and flavonoids; genes related to stress and defense responses; cell wall modification; cellular signaling; and transcriptional regulation.

To determine the optimal strategies for implementing association analysis in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), we analyzed the structure of LD in three regions of the genome varying in length from 336 to 574 kb. This analysis was conducted in four distinct groups of soybean germplasm: 26 accessions of the wild ancestor of soybean (Glycine soja Seib. et Zucc.); 52 Asian G. max Landraces, the immediate results of domestication from G. soja; 17 Asian Landrace introductions that became the ancestors of North American (N. Am.) cultivars, and 25 Elite Cultivars from N. Am. In G. soja, LD did not extend past 100 kb; however, in the three cultivated G. max groups, LD extended from 90 to 574 kb, likely due to the impacts of domestication and increased self-fertilization. The three genomic regions were highly variable relative to the extent of LD within the three cultivated soybean populations. G. soja appears to be ideal for fine mapping of genes, but due to the highly variable levels of LD in the Landraces and the Elite Cultivars, whole-genome association analysis in soybean may be more difficult than first anticipated.},

No differences in soybean yield among the treatments were detected. In a second experiment, a 1-m(2) area of each plot was infested with H. glycines cysts, susceptible soybeans were grown for four seasons, and crop residue was managed with either ridge-, conventional-, reduced-, or no-tillage. After I year, nematode population densities were significantly (P ! 0.05) greater in conventional- and reduced-tillage treatments than in no- and ridge-tillage treatments. After 2 years, H. glycines had been disseminated 6.9 m from the infestation site in conventional- and reduced-tillage treatments but only 0.5 and 1.4 m for no-tillage and ridge-tillage treatments, respectively. After 3 years, H. glycines population densities were 10 times greater in conventional- and reduced-tillage treatments than in the no-tillage treatment; conventional -tillage was the only treatment with yield significantly lower (P ! 0.05) than the noninfested control. Aggregation of H. glycines eggs was greater (P : 0.05) in no- and ridge-tillage treatments than in conventional- and reduced-tillage treatments. Results indicate tillage can quickly disseminate H. glycines in newly infested fields, facilitating more rapid nematode reproduction and subsequent yield loss.},

	Abstract = {A variety of genes expressed in preparasitic second-stage juveniles (J2) of plant-parasitic nematodes appear to be vulnerable to RNA interference (RNAi) in vitro by coupling double-stranded (ds)RNA soaking with the artificial stimulation of pharyngeal pumping. Also, there is mounting evidence that the in planta generation of nematode-specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) has real utility in the control of these pests. Although neuronally-expressed genes in Caenorhabditis elegans are commonly refractory to RNAi, we have discovered that neuronally-expressed genes in plant-parasitic nematodes are highly susceptible to RNAi and that silencing can be induced by simple soaking procedures without the need for pharyngeal stimulation. Since most front-line anthelmintics that are used for the control of nematode parasites of animals and humans act to disrupt neuromuscular coordination, we argue that intercellular signalling processes associated with neurons have much appeal as targets for transgenic plant-based control strategies for plant-parasitic nematodes. FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) are a large family of neuropeptides which are intimately associated with neuromuscular regulation, and our studies on flp gene function in plant-parasitic nematodes have revealed that their expression is central to coordinated locomotory activities. We propose that the high level of conservation in nervous systems across nematodes coupled with the RNAi-susceptibility of neuronally-expressed genes in plant-parasitic nematodes provides a valuable research tool which could be used to interrogate neuronal signalling processes in nematodes.},

	Abstract = {Background: The soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines is the most important parasite in soybean production worldwide. A comprehensive analysis of large-scale gene expression changes throughout the development of plant-parasitic nematodes has been lacking to date. Results: We report an extensive genomic analysis of H. glycines, beginning with the generation of 20,100 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). In-depth analysis of these ESTs plus approximately 1,900 previously published sequences predicted 6,860 unique H. glycines genes and allowed a classification by function using InterProScan. Expression profiling of all 6,860 genes throughout the H. glycines life cycle was undertaken using the Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array GeneChip. Our data sets and results represent a comprehensive resource for molecular studies of H. glycines. Demonstrating the power of this resource, we were able to address whether arrested development in the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva and the H. glycines infective second-stage juvenile (J2) exhibits shared gene expression profiles. We determined that the gene expression profiles associated with the C. elegans dauer pathway are not uniformly conserved in H. glycines and that the expression profiles of genes for metabolic enzymes of C. elegans dauer larvae and H. glycines infective J2 are dissimilar. Conclusion: Our results indicate that hallmark gene expression patterns and metabolism features are not shared in the developmentally arrested life stages of C. elegans and H. glycines, suggesting that developmental arrest in these two nematode species has undergone more divergent evolution than previously thought and pointing to the need for detailed genomic analyses of individual parasite species.},

	Abstract = {Cyst nematodes produce parasitism proteins that contain putative nuclear localisation signals (NLSs) and, therefore, are predicted to be imported into the nucleus of the host plant cell. The in planta localisation patterns of eight soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) parasitism proteins with putative NLSs were determined by producing these proteins as translational fusions with the GFP and GUS reporter proteins. Two parasitism proteins were found to be imported into the nuclei of onion epidermal cells as well as Arabidopsis protoplasts. One of these two parasitism proteins was further transported into the nucleoli. Mutations introduced into the NLS domains of these two proteins abolished nuclear import and caused a cytoplasmic accumulation. Furthermore, we observed active nuclear uptake for three additional parasitism proteins, however, only when these proteins were synthesised as truncated forms. Two of these proteins were further transported into nucleoli. We hypothesise that nuclear uptake and nucleolar localisation are important mechanisms for H. glycines to modulate the nuclear biology of parasitised cells of its host plant.

In RIL populations, four epistatic genes were identified which conditioned resistance to race 14, and three epistatic ones for resistance to races 3 and 9. The lack of one gene provided moderate resistance under all situations. The highest number of genes for resistance to race 14 points out that genes responsible for lower effects might be involved. In population F-2:3 from M-SOY 8001 x MB/BR 46 - Conquista, one recessive gene for moderate resistance and two recessive genes complete resistance to race 3 were identified. Two recessive genes conditioning moderate resistance to race 14 were identified in population F-2:3 from the crossing S5995 x BRSMG Renascenca. These results will be useful in designing crossings, involving these parentals, with higher possibility to accumulating genes that provide resistance to several SCN races.},

	Abstract = {A survey of seven production fields in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio was conducted to assess henbit and purple deadnettle growth and soybean cyst nematode (SCN) development and reproduction on these weeds. Autumn and spring growth of purple deadnettle and henbit was influenced by location within each state. In general, winter annual weeds were larger in size and reached maturity earlier in the spring at the southern sample sites than those in the north. All growth stages of SCN were found to be associated with henbit and purple deadnettle at both autumn and spring sample timings. SCN juveniles were generally found infecting roots at highest abundance in the spring. SCN cyst and egg production also were widespread and occurred to a much higher degree during the autumn than the spring developmental period. The results of this survey indicate that management tactics designed to minimize the potential for SCN reproduction on winter annual weeds would probably be most effective if conducted in the autumn, when the majority of SCN reproduction occurred. However, spring populations of winter annual weeds that harbor SCN juveniles might facilitate additional SCN reproduction and population increase if the weeds are not controlled in a timely manner prior to planting.},

	Abstract = {An experiment was conducted in growth chambers to determine the influence of cold temperature regimes, designed to simulate winter temperature conditions and spring recovery, on the interaction between purple deadnettle and soybean cyst nematode (SCN). The study was a factorial arrangement of treatments with five levels of temperature (20, 15, 10, 5, or 0 C), two levels of exposure time to the temperature (10 or 20 d), and two levels of recovery time at 20 C following exposure (0 or 20 d). In general, purple deadnettle shoot and root growth increased with temperature and time. The ability of purple deadnettle to recover from cold temperatures declined as the length of time that the plant was subjected to the cold temperature increased. SCN juveniles per gram of root at the conclusion of the temperature treatment declined as the temperature increased from 0 to 15 C, likely a result of continued purple deadnettle root growth and the inhibition of SCN hatch, growth, or development at those temperatures. SCN female, cyst, and egg production per gram of root generally increased with temperature and occurred under all temperature regimes. The results of this research indicate that, after hatching, SCN juveniles can survive a period of cold temperature inside the roots of a winter annual and continue development when transferred to warmer temperatures. Therefore, in a field environment, where fall or spring alone may not be sufficient for SCN to complete a reproductive cycle on a winter annual weed, the nematode may be able to reproduce by combining the fall and spring developmental periods.},

Crop management practices specifically aimed at managing the impact of SCN were employed by 55 and 78% of growers and CCAs, respectively. However, only 21% percent of growers said that they had sampled a field for nematodes within the last two years. Growers from eastern and southern Indiana were less likely to be concerned about SCN, to implement SCN management strategies, and to have the soil tested for SCN than growers throughout the rest of the state. In addition, smaller farmers appear to be less concerned and knowledgeable about SCN than those who operate larger farms. The results of this survey suggest that the majority of Indiana growers would likely adopt winter weed control to manage SCN.

	Abstract = {A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the effect of henbit and purple deadnettle density on weed biomass accumulation and soybean cyst nematode (SCN) reproduction. SCN did not impact shoot or root dry weight of purple deadnettle, henbit, or soybean. Foliar and root biomass of henbit and purple deadnettle were comparable but the biomass per stem was higher for purple deadnettle. Shoot and root biomass per pot of henbit and purple deadnettle at corresponding plant densities were statistically similar and were generally higher with increasing plant density. Henbit produced a greater number of stems than purple deadnettle and the least number of stems for both species existed at low densities. Purple deadnettle allowed for more SCN reproduction than did henbit. Weed densities also influenced SCN cyst and egg production but the results were species dependent. The highest SCN reproduction per pot was supported at low to moderate densities of purple deadnettle but at moderate to high densities of henbit. These results suggest that purple deadnettle should be more aggressively managed than henbit in management programs for SCN, but that henbit, especially at high densities, can support SCN reproduction at levels near those of purple deadnettle.},

Each experiment was a randomized complete block with a factorial treatment design including 23 cultivars with or without traits of resistance to SCN, and IDC. The study illustrated the interactive effects of the two defensive traits on the diseases and soybean yields. IDC rating was higher in SCN-susceptible than SCN-resistant soybean, suggesting SCN infection increased IDC. Resistance to IDC apparently increased SCN reproduction due to better soybean plant growth. Yield response to the defensive traits depended on the disease pressures in a field. When both IDC and SCN were present in a field, deploying SCN-resistance was the best solution to the problems. However, SCN-resistance suppressed soybean yields when used in fields without the disease problems. IDC-resistance increased yield of SCN-susceptible cultivars, but it did not result in detectable yield benefit of SCN-resistant cultivars in SCN-infested sites. Effective use of the defensive traits for management of IDC and SCN requires specific knowledge of the disease problems present in a field.},

	Abstract = {Conservation tillage has been increasingly used in the midwestern USA. Long-term effects of tillage practices on the soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, and soybean yields in corn-soybean rotation were studied in two fields in Minnesota (USA). The experiments were arranged in a split-plot design with tillage treatments as main plots and crop sequences as subplots. Tillage treatments were no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). The crop sequences were six (Waseca) or nine (New Richland) combinations of SCN-susceptible 'Sturdy', SCN-resistant 'Freeborn' ('PI 88788' resistance source) and 'Pioneer brand 9234' ('Peking' resistance source) soybean rotated annually with corn. Tillage did not affect SCN population density at New Richland and had only minimal and inconsistent effects on SCN at Waseca. However, CT resulted in up to 370 kg ha(-1) greater soybean yield than NT at Waseca. Growing SCN-resistant cultivars was effective in the corn-soybean rotation for managing SCN and minimizing yield loss to SCN. Resistant soybean not only reduced SCN population density and increased soybean yield in the year when it was grown, but also resulted in a smaller inoculum population density and increased yield of susceptible and resistant soybean in the following soybean years. Pioneer brand 9234 was more effective than Freeborn in reducing SCN population density and increasing soybean yield in the following years. This study confirmed that use of resistant cultivars is an effective tactic for SCN management, but tillage is not an option solely for managing SCN population in the northern climate and soil conditions.},

	Abstract = {The effect of tillage on parasitism of Heterodera glycines second-stage juvenile (12) by the nematophagous fungi Hirsutella rhossiliensis and/or Hirsutella minnesotensis and on J2 population density was investigated at four sites in soybean-corn rotation and one site in soybean monoculture in Minnesota. Soil samples were taken at planting, in midseason, and at harvest in 2002, at planting, I and 2 months after planting, and at harvest in 2003, and 2 weeks and 2 months after planting, and at harvest in 2004. Heterodera glycines J2 were extracted, and the number and percentage of J2 parasitized by Hirsutella were determined. No significant differences in the percentages of parasitized J2 were observed between conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) at all sampling dates, except that the percentage of J2 parasitized in NT was significantly higher than in CT during the soybean-growing season in 2003 at one site in the soybean-corn annual rotation. The percentage of J2 parasitized by Hirsutella was higher in soybean fields than in corn fields, and the percentage of J2 parasitized in midseason was generally higher than that at planting and harvest. Growing a resistant soybean cultivar in the preceding year reduced the percentage of J2 parasitized by Hirsutella in the following season. Conventional tillage increased the mid-season J2 population density during 2002-2004 soybean-grolAring seasons as compared with NT at two of the five sites.},

	Abstract = {Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse to evaluate soils for their degree of suppressiveness against the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. The soils were collected in 2003 and 2004 from two fields with long-term soybean monoculture and one field with corn/soybean annual rotation. The soils were autonclaved, treated with formalin, or untreated. Both formalin and autoclave treatments removed suppressive factors and increased the nematode egg population density as compared with untreated soil. The mixture of 10% untreated soil with 90% treated soil resulted in similar nematode population densities as in the untreated soils collected from the two monoculture fields, indicating the suppressive factors were biological and can be transferred. The soils from the monoculture fields appeared to be more suppressive than the soil from the corn/soybean rotation. Hirsutella rhossiliensis was observed in all three soils' and parasitised a large percentage of second-stage juveniles of H. glycines in the monoculture soils in 2004. The fungus may be a major factor for the suppression of the nematode population, but in this study other biological factors cannot be ruled out.},

	Abstract = {In order to identify genes involved in pathogenicity, we compared the closely related species Globodera pallida (GP) and Globodera "mexicana" (GM) that have different host ranges and are able to produce viable and fertile hybrids. Three pioneer genes were previously identified as differentially expressed between GP and GM:PLIA7 and GPLIB3 were found to be more highly expressed in GP, whereas GMLIVG9 was found more highly expressed in GM. In this study, we showed that Ia7 and IVg9 genes probably encode products secreted by the subventral oesophageal glands and the dorsal oesophageal gland, respectively. No Blast homolog was found in the databases, but a metridin-like ShK (Stichodactyla helianthus) toxin domain was identified in the Ia7 sequence. Analysis of the full-length sequences of these 2 genes between GP and GM revealed a high level of interspecies variability (8% for the Ia7 transcript and 17% for the IVg9 transcript) and a high proportion (90%) of non-synonymous mutations among the substitutions observed. This suggested that these 2 pioneer genes are under strong diversifying selection pressures and therefore may be involved in pathogenicity. Further investigations of the sequence polymorphism of Ia7 and IVg9 genes were conducted in GP x GM hybrid lines that were selected in laboratory conditions for their different ability to develop on potato and black nightshade. As similar sequences were obtained for all the hybrid fines tested independently of their pathogenicity status, no correlation could be established between IA7 and IVG9 amino acid changes and the host range differences observed between GP and GM.},

	Abstract = {Changes in transcript abundance of genes expressed in the three pharyngeal gland cells of Heterodera glycines after host invasion were monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the consequences of disrupting their expression studied by RNAi treatment prior to invasion. Two transcripts were known to be expressed in the two subventral gland cells (hg-pel and hg-eng-1), a further two in the single dorsal gland cell only (hg-gp and hg-syv46), and a fifth transcript (hg-cm) was expressed by both gland cell types. The qPCR study established that transcripts of hg-syv46 and hg-gp increased in abundance by 2 days postinfection (dpi), with the former remaining the most abundant. The hg-cm transcript level showed minor changes from 0 to 14 dpi but did fall by 21 dpi. In contrast, hg-eng-1 and hg-eng-2 messenger (m)RNA declined by 7 dpi and hg-pel by 14 dpi before it increased at 21 dpi. RNAi-targeting of hg-eng-1 reduced the number of females present on the plants at 10 days. Targeting of hg-gp, hg-cm, and hg-pel caused a change in sexual fate favoring male development on roots. Both effects were evident after targeting hg-syv46. Suppression of hg-eng-1 mRNA levels in second-stage juveniles (J2(i)) by RNAi was transient, with a recovery by 15 days of incubation in water after treatment. Presoaking H. glycines J2 with double-stranded RNA has value for studying gene function during the nematode's early interaction with a plant.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines) is a devastating obligate parasite of Glycine max (soybean) causing one billion dollars in losses to the US economy per year and over ten billion dollars in losses worldwide. While much is understood about the pathology of H. glycines, its genome sequence is not well characterized or fully sequenced. We sought to create bioinformatic tools to mine the H. glycines nucleotide database. One way is to use a comparative genomics approach by anchoring our analysis with an organism, like the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike H. glycines, the C. elegans genome is fully sequenced and is well characterized with a number of lethal genes identified through experimental methods. We compared an EST database of H. glycines with the C elegans genome. Our goal was identifying genes that may be essential for H. glycines survival and would serve as an automated pipeline for RNAi studies to both study and control H. glycines. Our analysis yielded a total of nearly 8334 conserved genes between H. glycines and C elegans. Of these, 1508 have lethal phenotypes/phenocopies in C elegans. RNAi of a conserved ribosomal gene from H. glycines (Hg-rps-23) yielded dead and dying worms as shown by positive Sytox fluorescence. Endogenous Hg-rps-23 exhibited typical RNA silencing as shown by RT-PCR. However, an unrelated gene Hg-une-87 did not exhibit RNA silencing in the Hg-rps-23 dsRNA-treated worms, demonstrating the specificity of the silencing. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Monitoring the population dynamics of a biocontrol agent in soil requires comprehensive techniques and is essential to understand how it works. Bioassay based on the fungal parasitism on the juveniles of soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, can be used to evaluate the activity of the fungus but fails to quantify fungal biomass in soil. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed to quantify the fungal population density ill soil. The assay detected as little as 100 fg of fungal genomic DNA and 40 conidia g(-1) soil, respectively. The parasitism bioassay and the real-time PCR assay were carried out to investigate the presence, abundance and activity of H. rhossiliensis in soil after application of different inoculum levels. Both of the percentage of assay nematodes parasitized by H. rhossiliensis based on the parasitism bioassay and the DNA yield of the fungus quantified by real-time PCR increased significantly with the increase of the inoculum levels. The DNA yield of the fun-LIS was positively correlated with the percentage of assay nematodes parasitized by H. rhossiliensis. The combination of the two is useful for monitoring fungal biomass and activity in soil. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Crude aqueous extracts (1: 15 dry weight plant/volume water) were made from velvetbean plant parts, and various concentrations of the extracts were evaluated in vitro for toxicities to different stages of Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood and for suppression of hypocotyl. and root growth and inhibition of germination of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Germination was only affected by the full-strength extract from leaf blades. Lettuce root growth was the most sensitive indicator of allelopathic activity of the plant part extracts. Lettuce and tomato root growth was more sensitive to the extract from main roots than to extracts of other plant parts, with lethal concentration (LC50) values of 1.2 and 1.1% respectively. Meloidogyne incognita egg hatch was less sensitive to extracts from velvetbean than the juvenile (J2) stage. There was no difference among LC50 values of the extracts from different plant parts against the egg stage. Based on LC50 values, the extract from fine roots was the least toxic to J2 (LC50 39.9%), and the extract from vines the most toxic (LC50 7.8%). The effects of the extracts were nematicidal because LC50 values did not change when the extracts were removed and replaced with water. Published in 2006 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Resistant varieties useful for stable soybean production in South America need to be developed, especially in light of outbreaks of pest and insect infestations, which are significant problems in this region. DNA markers can be used as precise and efficient tools for the introduction of resistance genes in plant breeding. The purpose of this study was to identify DNA markers that could be used in breeding programs for resistance against soybean diseases, and to use DNA markers to evaluate the genetic relationships among soybean genetic resources. We identified four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance against soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) that explain nearly 50% of the phenotypic variation of the population used. The QTLs detected here differ from those previously identified for Fusarium virguliforme in North America. Three major genes for resistance to soybean rust, Rpp, Rpp2, and Rpp4, were mapped with DNA markers on linkage groups C2, J, and G, respectively. These maps were obtained by bulked segregant analysis (BSA) by using three independent F2 populations and their F3 and/or F4 progenies. Rpp2 and Rpp4 were located near regions where the genes for resistance to other fungal pathogens and genes for soybean cyst nematode resistance cluster. The DNA markers identified here can be used for the introduction of these resistance genes into soybean cultivars and for the accumulation of resistance genes into one line. Next, to evaluate the viability of introducing external gene pools to Brazilian soybeans, we evaluated the genetic relationships among Japanese, Chinese, and Brazilian soybean germplasms by using 12 DNA markers and a total of 261 varieties. Hayashi's Quantification Theory III (QT III) and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering analysis revealed that the Chinese and Japanese varieties were classified as not independent but quite distant. The Brazilian varieties were distantly related to the Chinese and Japanese varieties and formed a cluster that was distant from the gene pools of Japan and China. Therefore, we expect that exchange of soybean genetic resources among these regions would expand their genetic bases and increase variability, especially when Brazilian varieties are used for soybean breeding in Japan and China or when Chinese varieties are used for breeding programs in Brazil.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome (SIDS) of soybean is caused by the soilborne Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines (synonym F. virguliforme). In a sequential approach, two multifactor factorial-design microplot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of fungal infestation levels and soil moisture on both root necrosis and foliar SDS severity, and the interaction between F. solani f. sp. glycines and Heterodera glycines in fumigated versus nonfumigated soil. In 2003, soybean cv. Spencer was grown in fumigated or methyl bromide-fumigated soil and infested with increasing levels of F. solani f. sp. glycines, either under rainfall or irrigated after growth stage V6/R1. In 2004, interactions between F. solani f. sp. glycines and H. glycines were explored in a factorial inoculation design in fumigated or nonfumigated soil, planted to Williams 82 or Cyst-X20-18. In both years, higher levels of foliar SIDS severity and root necrosis were found in F. solani f. sp. glycines-infested soils with H. glycines than in soils without the nematode on the soybean cultivars susceptible to both pathogens. Both natural infestations of H. glycines in 2003 and artificially amended populations of H. glycines in 2004 contributed to higher foliar SIDS severity. More severe foliar SIDS symptoms always were associated with more root necrosis. but elevated levels of root necrosis did not predict severe leaf symptoms. In contrast to the critical role of H. glycines, increasing fungal infestation levels had no significant effects on increasing either foliar SDS symptoms or root necrosis. Effects of moisture regime and fungal infestation levels also were examined in factorial greenhouse and growth chamber experiments. High soil moisture resulted in higher levels of SIDS root necrosis. In the greenhouse, root necrosis increased at a higher rate in low soil moisture than the rate in high soil moisture. The two pathogens acted as a complex and the disease development was strongly dependent on high soil moisture.},

	Abstract = {Plants produce a wide range of biologically active chemicals which have been extensively explored for nematode-antagonistic properties. Although phenylpropanoids are part of the chemical defence system of plants against pests and diseases, including parasitic nematodes, no comprehensive study exists which relates (levels of) phenylpropanoid compounds in roots to actual effects on nematode behaviour. Therefore, a broad spectrum evaluation was made of the effects of phenylpropanoids (simple phenolics and flavonoids) and selected monoterpenoids and alkaloids on the behaviour of the migratory endoparasites Radopholus similis and Pratylenchus penetrans and the sedentary endoparasite Meloidogyne incognita. In vitro bioassays assessed effects on chemotaxis, motility, viability and hatch. Compared with the other two nematode species, P. penetrans was remarkably insensitive to the test Compounds. Only phloretin was (limited) hatch inhibitive. This property was shared by other chalcone-related compounds for R. similis. Repellents and motility inhibitors for R. similis and M. incognita were found among the simple phenolic compounds. Flavonols stood out as repellent compounds for both these nematode species, while they were, in their degraded form, also motility inhibitors for M. incognita. Dopamine was an attractant for R. similis, while ferulic acid was strongly motility inhibitive and toxic (LC50 Of 120 mu g ml(-1)) for this nematode species. Salicylic acid was a strong attractant for M. incognita. The compound was also nematicidal (LC50 of 46 mu g ml(-1)) and an it-reversible inhibitor of hatch.},

Soybean cyst nematode suppressed US soybean yield more during 2003 to 2005 than any other disease. Phytophthora root and stein rot, sudden death syndrome, and seedling diseases ranked in the top four on the list of diseases that suppressed soybean yield during these years.

	Abstract = {Soyabean cyst nematode (SCN) is the primary pest responsible for yield losses of Glycine max. Management of SCN remains difficult in commercial soyabean production due to the length of its biological cycle, frequent changes in population virulence, and ease of spread via infested soil. Effective management relies on crop rotation in combination with resistant cultivars, which have been derived from a limited germplasm base. Breeding for SCN resistance in soyabean is difficult due to the quantitative nature of the trait, genetic variation within SCN populations, time required for phenotyping experimental soyabean lines, and environmental factors affecting SCN reproduction. Quantitative trait loci associated with SCN resistance have been identified on 17 of the 20 soyabean linkage groups, explaining 1-91% of the total phenotypic variation. Two major resistance genes, rhg 1 and Rhg 4, have been identified on linkage groups G and A2, respectively. Several minor resistance genes have been identified, but their importance varies with germplasm source and nematode race. Enhancement of SCN resistance in G. max may be achieved by interspecific hybridization with G. soja, the wild ancestor, or by engineering plants with candidate resistance genes such as Hs1pro-1.},

	Abstract = {Parasitic nematodes infect thousands of plant species, but some plants harbor specific resistance genes that defend against these pests. Several nematode resistance genes have been cloned in plants, and most resemble other plant resistance genes. Nematode resistance is generally characterized by host plant cell death near or at the feeding site of the endoparasitic worm. The timing and localization of the resistance response varies with the particular resistance gene and nematode interaction. Although there is genetic evidence that single genes in the nematode can determine whether a plant mounts a resistance response, cognate nematode effectors corresponding to a plant resistance gene have not been identified. However, recent progress in genetics and genomics of both plants and nematodes, and developments in RNA silencing strategies are improving our understanding of the molecular players in this complex interaction. In this article, we review the nature and mechanisms of plant-nematode interactions with respect to resistance in plants.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium, solani f. sp. glycines, is a season-long root disease of soybean (Glycine max) with foliar symptoms beginning in late vegetative and early reproductive stages of plant growth. The disease has been reported in most soybean-growing regions of the United States of America and the world. Previous research found that SDS was less severe in areas that were subsoiled when compared with those with no-till. The objectives of the current study were to determine (i) if cost-effective tillage practices, i.e., chisel plowing and disk tillage, can be efficient in reducing SDS and (ii) if cultivars with a range of SDS resistance or susceptibility respond differently in SDS expression across various tillage practices. In the fall of 2000 and 2001, plots were established in a field with a history of severe SDS and with a soil type consisting of an Armiesburg silty clay loam. The experiment was organized in a split-plot design with four replications. Main plots were tillage (chisel tillage, disk tillage, and no tillage), and subplots were cultivars randomized in main plots. Twelve cultivars were selected based on resistance or susceptibility to SDS. In 2000, chisel tillage reduced the area under the foliar disease progress curve (AUFDPC) when compared with no-till or disk tillage. In 2001, both chisel and disk tillage reduced AUFDPC similarly when compared with no-till. In 2000, the rate of root infection by the fungus, that is, the area under the root colonization progress curve (AURCPC), was higher in both disk- and chisel-tillage treatments than in no-tillage treatments. In 2001, higher rates of root infection occurred with chisel tillage compared with disk tillage and no-till. Among the cultivars, foliar disease ratings, AUFDPC, and soybean yield differed, but there were no differences in the AURCPC.},

	Abstract = {The genome of pea ( Pisum sativum) contains genes encoding a family of distinct lipoxygenases (LOX). Among these, LOXN2 showed eight exons encoding a 93.7-kD enzyme, harboring two C-terminal deletions and an unusual arginine/threonine-tyrosine motif in the domain considered to control the substrate specificity. LOXN2, when overexpressed in yeast, exhibited normal enzyme activity with an optimum at pH 4.5, and a dual positional specificity by releasing a 3: 1 ratio of C-9 and C-13 oxidized products. The predicted LOXN2 structure lacked a loop present in soybean (Glycine max) LOX1, in a position consistent with control of the degree of substrate access to the catalytic site and for LOXN2's dual positional specificity. The LOXN2 gene was tightly conserved in the Progress 9 and MG103738 genotypes, respectively, susceptible and resistant to the root cyst nematode Heterodera goettingiana. LOXN2 transcription was monitored in roots after mechanical injury and during nematode infection. The message peaked at 3 and 24 h after wounding in both genotypes and was more abundant in the resistant than in the susceptible pea. In nematode-infected roots, transcription of several LOX genes was triggered except LOXN2, which was repressed in both genotypes. In situ hybridization revealed that LOXN2 message was widespread in the cortex and endodermis of healthy roots, but specifically localized at high level in the cells bordering the nematode-induced syncytia of infected roots. However, LOXN2 transcript signal was particularly intense in collapsing syncytia of MG103738 roots, suggesting LOXN2 involvement in late mechanisms of host resistance.},

	Abstract = {Root-feeding nematodes may play an important role in generating spatial and temporal variation in natural plant communities, but little is known about the performance of the nematodes in the plant root zone. We studied the emergence, survival and reproductive success of the cyst nematode Heterodera arenaria, a root feeding-specialist that occurs in mobile dunes. The host plants of H. arenaria are buried regularly by windblown sand to which the plants respond by upward clonal expansion. As a consequence, the nematodes have to migrate upwards in the soil profile to find new roots for feeding and reproduction, however, not all juveniles migrate. We tested the hypothesis that the offspring from migrated individuals would perform better than from individuals that remained behind and discuss the advantage of this dualistic behavior. The individual performance of the cyst nematodes was better when their juveniles migrated to the new root layer. In the field, in the new root layer the cysts had more eggs and juveniles than cysts collected from the 1-year-old root layer. Under controlled conditions, cysts from the new root layer released their first juveniles faster than cysts from the 1-year-old root layer. However, the juveniles that do not migrate might be crucial for the persistence of the population. In the past decade in two extremely dry years, we could not find cysts in the new root layer. Apparently, summer drought constrains cyst formation, so that the cysts produced in the older root layers serve as a reservoir for the population. Such reservoirs could become more important when climate change will result in increased incidence of summer droughts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Variations in carbon requirements were found among the fungal species or strains tested. All strains studied except for T. viride grew on most carbon sources, although B. bassiana had more fastidious requirements for spore germination. Monosaccharides and disaccharides were suitable for fungal growth. For most isolates, d-glucose, d-mannose, sucrose and trehalose were superior to pectin and soluble starch among the polysaccharides and lactic acid among the organic acids. Both ethanol and methanol could accelerate growth of most isolates but not biomass. d-mannose, d-fructose and d-xylose were excellent carbon sources for sporulation, while d-glucose, sucrose, cellobiose, trehalose, chitin, dextrin, gelatin and lactic acid were better for some isolates. Neither sorbic acid nor linoleic acid could be utilized as a single carbon source. These findings provided a better understanding of the nutritional requirements of different fungal biocontrol agents that can benefit the mass production process.},

A total of 455 fungal isolates belonging to 24 genera and 52 isolates of actinomycetes were obtained from 28 samples from greenhouses and fields in Hainan, Yunnan, Fujian, Hebei, Shandong, and Beijing. The predominant fungal species were Paecilomyces lilacinus (49.3% of the isolates), Fusarium spp. (7.9%), Pochonia chlamydosporia (6.9%), Penicillium spp. (5.7%), Aspergillus spp. (3.2%), and Acremonium spp. (2.8%). Actinomycetes were frequently encountered (10.3%) as well. A total of 350 isolates of nematophagous fungi and actinomycetes were evaluated for their parasitism of eggs and effects on egg hatch and juvenile mortality in vitro. Pathogenicity varied among isolates, and 29.1% of isolates parasitized over 90% eggs 4 days after inoculation. Results also show that seven isolates of fungi and actinomycetes reduced egg hatch rates to less than 10% contrasted to the control of 65.8%, and three isolates killed all hatched juveniles after 7 days. Seventeen fungal isolates and four actinomycete isolates with high pathogenicity in vitro were selected to test biocontrol efficacy in the greenhouse. They reduced tomato root gall index by 13.4-58.9% compared to the no treatment control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this study, the hypothesis that female counts are as efficient as egg counts in identifying resistant genotypes was tested. In two greenhouse experiments Gossypium genotypes which varied from resistant to susceptible to reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) were compared to a susceptible control cultivar. Infested field soil served as the inoculum source for the first experiment, and vermiform stages extracted from greenhouse cultures were used to infest soil in the second experiment. Six replicates of each genotype were harvested 25 d after planting and swollen females were counted. The remaining plants were harvested 35 d after planting and eggs extracted from the roots were counted. Processing and counting times recorded in the first experiment were similar for both assessment methods, but 10 additional days were required for egg-based assessment. Contrast analyses showed that assessments based on females per gram of root were equivalent to assessments based on eggs per gram of root for the five genotypes tested in the first experiment and for an expanded set of 13 genotypes tested in the second experiment. The results indicated that either life stage can be used to screen for resistance.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is the major disease-causing agent limiting soybean production in the USA. The current management strategy to reduce yield loss by SCN involves the deployment of resistant soybean cultivars and rotation to non-host crops. Although this management scheme has shown some success, continued yearly yield loss estimates demonstrate the limitations of these techniques. As a result, new control strategies are needed to complement the existing methods. Reported here is a novel method of SCN control that utilises RNA interference (RNAi). Transgenic soybeans were generated following transformation with an RNAi expression vector containing inverted repeats of a cDNA clone of the major sperm protein (MSP) gene from H. glycines. The accumulation of MSP-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules were detected by northern blot analysis of transgenic soybeans. T-0 plants displaying MSP siRNA accumulation were deployed in a bioassay to evaluate the effects of MSP interfering molecules on H. glycines reproduction. Bioassay data has shown up to a 68% reduction in eggs g(-1) root tissue, demonstrating that MSPi transgenic plants significantly reduced the reproductive potential of H. glycines. An additional bioassay evaluating progeny nematodes for maintenance of reproductive suppression indicated that progeny were also impaired in their ability to successfully reproduce, as demonstrated by a 75% reduction in eggs g(-1) root tissue. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of an RNAi-based strategy for control of the soybean cyst nematode. In addition, these results may have important implications for the control of other plant parasitic nematodes.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines Hg-hsd-1 and Hg-hsd-2 are two homologues of let-767, a short-chain dehydrogenase gene from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Both genes share similarity to 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17 beta-HSDs), enzymes known to be involved in the production of steroid hormones in mammals. Hg-hsd-1 and Hg-hsd-2 encode distinct protein sequences that share 51% amino acid identity with each other and 48% identity with LET-767. The Hg-HSD-1 protein sequence was most similar to those encoded by ESTs from the lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, and Hg-HSD-2 protein was most similar to sequences from another cyst nematode, Globodera pallida. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed the highest expression of both genes in developing females, with relatively low levels in second-stage juveniles, eggs, or males. Transcription levels of both genes declined as females aged, decreasing with increased cuticle pigmentation. Transcription was up-regulated in the cyst bodies and fluid that had been manually separated from the developing embryos, suggesting that Hg-hsd-1 and Hg-hsd-2 are most likely involved in gonad development or oogenesis in the female. It is possible that these 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases are involved in the conversion of sterols, which nematodes must ingest from dietary sources, into necessary steroid hormones.},

The homeologous BACs were genetically mapped to linkage groups C1 and C2. Annotation of the 173,747- and 98,760-bp BACs showed that gene conservation in both order and orientation is high between homeologous regions with only a single gene insertion/deletion and local tandem duplications differing between the regions. The nucleotide sequence conservation extends into intergenic regions as well, probably due to conserved regulatory sequences. Most of the homeologs appear to have a role in either transcription/DNA binding or cellular signaling, Suggesting a potential preference for retention of duplicate genes with these functions. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of homeologs showed that in the tissues sampled, most homeologs have not diverged greatly in their transcription profiles. However, four cases of changes in transcription were identified, primarily in the HCBT gene cluster. Because a mapped locus corresponds to a soybean cyst nematode (SCN) QTL, the potential role of HCBT genes in response to SCN is discussed. These results are the first sequenced-based analysis of homeologous BACs in soybean, L diploidized palcopolyploid.},

	Abstract = {The rhg1 gene or genes lie at a recessive or co-dominant locus, necessary for resistance to all Hg types of the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines I.). The aim here was to identify nucleotide changes within a candidate gene found at the rhg1 locus that were capable of altering resistance to Hg types 0 (race 3). A 1.5+or-0.25 cM region of chromosome 18 (linkage group G) was shown to encompass rhg1 using recombination events from four near isogenic line populations and nine DNA markers. The DNA markers anchored two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones 21d9 and 73p6. A single receptor like kinase (RLK; leucine rich repeat-transmembrane-protein kinase) candidate resistance gene was amplified from both BACs using redundant primers. The DNA sequence showed nine alleles of the RLK at Rhg1 in the soybean germplasm. Markers designed to detect alleles showed perfect association between allele 1 and resistance to soybean cyst nematode Hg types 0 in three segregating populations, fifteen additional selected recombination events and twenty-two Plant Introductions. A quantitative trait nucleotide in the RLK at rhg1 was inferred that alters A47 to V47 in the context of H297 rather than N297. Contiguous DNA sequence of 315 kbp of chromosome 18 (about 2 cM) contained additional gene candidates that may modulate resistance to other Hg-types including a variant laccase, a hydrogen-sodium ion antiport and two proteins of unknown function. A molecular basis for recessive and co-dominant resistance that involves interactions among paralagous disease-resistance genes was inferred that would improve methods for developing new nematode-resistant soybean cultivars.},

A population of H. glycines was obtained from the soybean field where infected nematodes were first discovered in order to conduct TEM studies of females and males and to determine the phylogenetic position of the H. glycines ensosymbiont among bacteria by studying the 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences. The bacterium was observed in the pseudocoelom and intestine of juveniles, females and males, in hypodermal chords of juveniles and males, in ovary walls and in oocytes and spermatozoa. The bacterium was polymorphic, measuring 0(.)4-0(.)8 x 2(.)5-4(.)5 mu m, and many specimens contained an array of microfilament-like structures similar to those observed in 'Candidatus Cardinium hertigii', the endosymbiont of Encarsia spp. wasps. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes of the H. glycines-infecting bacterium revealed 93% and 81% sequence identity, respectively, to the homologous genes in 'Candidatus C. hertigii'.

Despite the availability of hundreds of H. glycines-resistant soybean cultivars, the nematode continues to be a major limiting factor in soybean production. The use of nonhost rotation and resistance are the primary means of reducing losses caused by the nematode, but each of these options has disadvantages. As a subject for study of nematode parasitism and virulence, H. glycines provides a useful model despite its obligately parasitic nature. Its obligately sexual reproduction and ready adaptation to resistant cultivars, formerly referred to as "race shift," presents an excellent opportunity for the study of virulence in nematodes. Recent advances in H. glycines genomics have helped identify putative nematode parasitism genes, which, in turn, will aid in the understanding of nematode pathogenicity and virulence and may provide new targets for engineering nematode resistance.},

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of field inoculation, soil compaction, and irrigation on the occurrence and severity of SDS symptoms. Six inoculation treatments were tested which included applications of FSG-infested grain planted in the furrow with the soybean seed, broadcasted and incorporated into the soil before planting, or placed below the soybean seed just before planting. Soil was compacted by driving a tractor across the field once in early spring. Irrigation treatments were applied at combinations of growth stages V3, V7, R3, R4, and/or R5. Significant increases in foliar SDS severity were observed from inoculation and irrigation treatments (P < 0.05), but not from compaction treatments. The inoculation treatments that placed inoculum close to the seed resulted in the greatest foliar severity. Irrigation treatments during mid to late reproductive growth stages resulted in significant increases in SOS foliar symptom development. These results increase our understanding of what environmental conditions increase SDS field symptoms and will be useful to researchers establishing SDS field nurseries.},

In the soybean studies, race 4 SCN population densities increased (P = 0.08) in the nontreated control and remained stable (P = 0.55) with fall-applied chlorimuron + sulfentrazone from fall 2001 to spring 2002 while SCN population densities were reduced (P = 0.06) with spring-applied chlorimuron + sulfentrazone from fall 2002 to spring 2003. In the corn studies, none of the winter-annual weed management strategies reduced (P > 0.22) race 2 SCN population densities except winter rye from fall 2001 to spring 2002 (P = 0.05). This research indicates that control of weed species considered to be weak alternative hosts for SCN affected SCN population densities some instances when race 4 SCN population densities were high in a continuous soybean production system or race 2 SCN population densities were low in a 2-yr corn production system.},

	Abstract = {Substituted xylan polymers constitute a major part of the hemicellulose fraction of plant cell walls, especially in monocotyledons. Endo-1,4-beta-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) are capable of hydrolyzing substituted xylan polymers into fragments of random size. Many herbivorous animals have evolved intimate relationships with endosymbionts to exploit their enzyme complexes for the degradation of xylan. Here, we report the first finding of a functional endo-1,4-beta-xylanase gene from an animal. The gene (Mi-xyl1) was found in the obligate plant-parasitic root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, and encodes a protein that is classified as a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The expression of Mi-xyl1 is localized in the subventral esophageal gland cells of the nematode. Previous studies have shown that M. incognita has the ability to degrade cellulose and pectic polysaccharides in plant cell walls independent of endosymbionts. Including our current data on Mi-xyl1, we show that the endogenous enzyme complex in root-knot nematode secretions targets essentially all major cell wall carbohydrates to facilitate a stealthy intercellular migration in the host plant.},

	Abstract = {Crop rotation is an effective tactic for soybean cyst nematode (SCN) management. In the North Central region of the USA, corn is almost exclusively used as a nonhost rotation crop with soybean. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of crops common to or having potential use in the North Central region as rotation crops for managing SCN. Sixteen potential rotation crops and SCN-resistant and susceptible soybeans were grown along with six fallow controls in three commercial field sites near Waseca, Lamberton, and Morris, MN, in 2001, and SCN-susceptible soybean was grown on all plots in 2002. Nematode populations at planting, midseason, and harvest were measured both years; soybean yield was measured in 2002. There was large variability in SCN populations and soybean yields at the three sites. Nevertheless, significant treatment effects were detected at all sites. While all of the rotation crops lowered SCN populations compared with SCN-susceptible soybean, there were only subtle differences among the individual rotation crops and among different groups of the crops. Leguminous nonhosts or poor hosts were best in reducing SCN population density. Corn, the most common rotation crop in Minnesota, was among the least effective in reducing nematode populations. There was an undetectable yield benefit from SCN management, although differences in yield were observed among the rotation crop treatments-probably due to agronomic factors. The data suggest that a single year of rotation of soybean with any of these crops before planting a susceptible soybean may not be sufficient in managing SCN.},

No effect of the fungal treatments and nematode treatments on tomato plant heights and shoot dry weights was observed. While all M. hapla populations were suppressed by H. minnesotensis, the degree to which each population was affected varied slightly. Across fungal treatments and nematode populations, the fungus reduced total number of nematodes in roots by 61-98%, with the highest for NYG and RI, intermediate for NYL and CT, and lowest for MI and WI populations.

	Abstract = {In the absence of resistant cultivars, the impending loss of methyl bromide (MBr) and few sustainable alternatives available, managing the northern root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne hapla, is a challenge in temperate vegetable and nursery production systems. Many brassica plants, including arugula, Eruca sativa, possess biofumigant and trap crop qualities, and thus have been gaining popularity as potential alternatives to MBr. As part of a project to develop alternatives to MBr, this study was conducted to determine the effects of arugula cv. Nemat on three glasshouse populations of M. hapla from Rhode Island (RI), New York, Geneva (NYG) and Michigan (MI). In two glasshouse experiments conducted at 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 28 +/- 2 degrees C, arugula and Rutgers tomato (standard susceptible) seedlings were inoculated with either 0 (control) or 3000 eggs of 67-85% undifferentiated stages of the three populations. Experiment I was terminated at 20 days and Experiment 2 at 28 days after nematode inoculation. At 20 degrees C, 200 and 280 degree-days (DD, base 10 degrees C) were accumulated, while 360 and 504 DD were accumulated at 28 degrees C in the respective experiments. Total numbers of nematodes recovered from roots varied by host and by nematode population over the course of the study, but the numbers of females in roots did not vary significantly. This suggests variability in reaching the adult female stage. Egg and egg mass production was normal in all nematode-infected tomatoes, but no eggs were produced in more than 80% of arugula plants, and less than 17% of the arugula samples had fewer than five loose eggs and no egg masses. The results show that arugula interferes with development and reproduction of populations of M. hapla and thus has potential as a trap crop to control M. hapla.},

A recycled municipal biosolid with nutrition supplement and liming qualities, N-Viro Soil (NVS) has potential as a multi-purpose soil amendment. In three greenhouse experiments, the effects of 0, 1.0 or 4.0 g NVS/100 cm(3) of sandy loam soil on three H. glycives populations (GN1, GN2 and GN3) were investigated on soybean grown for 557 68 degree-days (base 10 degrees C). The response of the three H. glycines Populations to NVS treatment varied by experiment. The overall numbers of preadult stages and cysts generally decreased with increasing levels of NVS in all experiments, and the high rate was more effective than the low rate in suppressing H. glycines numbers. This suggests that the high NVS treatment can affect the three populations in the experimental soil type tinder controlled conditions.

FUE is defined as increase in host productivity and/or decrease in nematode population density in response to a given fertiliser treatment. This study describes new and integrated approaches to identify FUE in nematode-infected plants. In two consecutive experiments, Heterodera glycines-resistant 'Bryan', susceptible-tolerant 'G88-20092', and susceptible-intolerant 'Tracy M' soybean cultivars were inoculated with 0 or 15 000 eggs of Meloidogyne incognita or mixed stages of Pratylenchus penetrans per 800 cm(3) of sandy loam soil and maintained under glasshouse conditions (28 +/- 2 degrees C) for 25 and 26 days. Plants received 83 +/- 21 and 89 +/- 19 ml either full-strength Hoagland solution (HS), HS without N (HS-N), or tap water daily in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Photosynthesis and nematode population dynamics were chosen to test FUE because the relationship between these two parameters, for the most part, determines the outcome of crop yield in the presence of nematodes. Although the FUE varied by fertiliser source, cultivar and nematode, the data were conclusive in identifying the interactions. FUE was high for photosynthesis in all three cultivars, and more so in HS than in HS-N. FUE was high for Suppressing Population densities of both nematodes and increasing photosynthesis in cv. Tracy M and for M. incognita in cv. G88-20092. Fertiliser application against P. penetrans in cv. Bryan was unproductive because nematode population density increased. FUE for P. penetrans in cv. G88-20092 and for M. incognita in cv. Bryan was less conclusive because there was some increase in nematode population density. Overall, these new approaches to identifying FUE for host productivity in the presence of nematodes provide quantitative data that should be of great interest to plant breeders, soil scientists, agronomists and plant protection specialists.},

	Abstract = {The plant-parasitic cyst nematode Heterodera glycines requires a host plant to complete its life cycle, which involves hatching of infective juveniles that parasitize through root entry. A laboratory population of H. glycines grown on soybean, Glycine max, undergoes a sharp increase in maturity between 5 and 6 weeks in culture, as measured by the proportion of eggs containing well developed pre-hatch juveniles (late development eggs) versus eggs without visible juveniles (early development eggs). The median percent of eggs classified as late development, representing all samples taken from 4 to 7 weeks in culture, was 61%. For all samples taken up to 5 weeks, 80% scored below the median. In samples taken after 5 weeks, 15% scored below the median. This shift in population maturity was accompanied by a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the number of hatched juveniles present in each sample. There was also a significant increase (P < 0.02) in amount of FaRP-like peptide detected by specific ELISA. Total FaRP levels increased from 0.18 +/- 0.07 fMol FLRFamide equivalents per ng protein in early development eggs to 0.40 +/- 0.17 in late development eggs. The level remained high in hatched juveniles. HPLC/ELISA detected as many as nine potential FaRPs in H. glycines, two of which were specifically increased (P < 0.005) in hatched juveniles. The association of FaRPs with maturing eggs and the possible involvement of these neuropeptides with juvenile hatching and motility are discussed.},

The best method of control of SCN is through the development of resistant cultivars.

The distribution and phenotype of 432 immune or highly resistant Chinese accessions were surveyed and a primary core collection was selected as a representative sample for further analyses. Using evenly distributed simple sequence repeat markers, five selection methods were applied to the primary core collection and the optimal method was chosen to establish a core collection, which consisted of 28 accessions. These encompassed 70.8% of the allelic variation present in the overall resistant collection. The 28 accessions differed from the reference resistant accessions at the genomic level, indicating that Chinese resistant accessions are distinct from known resistant accessions. This applied core collection provides a rational framework for undertaking diversity surveys, using genetic variation for the investigation of complex traits and for the discovery of novel traits.},

	Abstract = {Soybean Cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines Ichinohe is the most serious pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in the world and genetic resistance in soybean cultivars have been the most effective means of control. Nematode populations, however, are variable and have adapted to reproduce on resistant cultivars over time due mainly to the narrow genetic base of SCN resistance in G. max. The majority of the resistant cultivars trace to two soybean accessions. It is hoped that new sources of resistance might provide durable resistance. Soybean plant introductions PI 467312 and PI 507354, are unique because they provide resistance to several nematode populations, i.e. SCN HG types 0, 2.7, and 1.3.6.7 (corresponding to races 3, 5, and 14) and HG types 2.5.7, 0, and 2.7 (corresponding to races 1, 3, and 5), respectively. The genetic basis of SCN resistance in these PIs is not yet known. We have investigated the inheritance of resistance to SCN HG types 0, 2.7, and 1.3.6.7 (races 3, 5, and14) in PI467312 and the SCN resistance to SCN HG types 2.5.7 and 2.7 (races 1 and 5) in PI 507354. PI 467312 was crossed to 'Marcus', a susceptible cultivar to generate F-1 hybrids, 196 random F-2 individuals, and 196 F-2:3 families (designated as Pop 467). PI 507354 and the cultivar Hutcheson, susceptible to all known SCN races, were crossed to generate F-1 hybrids, 225 random F-2 individuals and 225 F-2:3 families (designated as Pop 507). The F-2:3 families from each cross were evaluated for responses to the specific SCN HG types in the greenhouse. Chi-square (chi(2)) analyses showed resistance from PI 467312 to HG types 2.7, and 1.3.6.7 (races 5 and 14) in Pop 467 were conditioned by one dominant and two recessive genes (Rhg rhg rhg) and resistance to HG type 0 (race 3) was controlled by three recessive genes (rhg rhg rhg). The 225 F-2:3 progenies in Pop 507 showed a segregation of 2:223 (R:S) for response to both HG types 2.5.7 and 2.7 (corresponding to races 1 and 5). The Chi-square analysis showed SCN resistance from PI 507354 fit a one dominant and 3 recessive gene model (Rhg rhg rhg rhg). This information will be useful to soybean breeders who use these sources to develop SCN resistant cultivars. The complex inheritance patterns determined for the two PIs are similar to the three and four gene models for other SCN resistance sources known to date.},

Here we describe a new gene, named MI-eng-2, that encodes a family 5 glycosyl hydrolase (GHF5) with a predicted signal peptide and devoid of linker domain and cellulose-binding domain. The beta-1,4-endoglucanase activity of the protein MI-ENG-2 was confirmed in vitro and the transcription of the gene was localized in the secretory oesophageal glands of infective juveniles, suggesting that MI-ENG-2 is involved in plant cell wall degradation during parasitism. Phylogenetic and exon/intron structure analyses of beta-1,4-endoglucanase genes in the order Tylenchida strengthen the hypothesis that nematode GHF5 genes result from horizontal gene transfer of a bacterial gene with a cellulose-binding domain. GHF5 gene families in Tylenchida result from gene duplications associated with occasional loss of the cellulose-binding domain and the linker domain during their evolution.

	Abstract = {Segregation distortion has been reported repeatedly in soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) inbred line populations segregating for the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) resistance gene rhg1. In each reported case, the frequency of the SCN resistance allele at the rhg1 locus was lower than expected. Segregation distortion was studied in 51 F-4 populations by counting the number of plants predicted to be homozygous resistant, susceptible, and heterozygous for rhg1 based on the genetic markers Satt309, CTA, or TMA5. Significant (P < 0.05) segregation distortion was observed in 44 out of the 51 F-4 populations. When the heterozygotes were ignored, there were significantly fewer homozygous-resistant plants than expected in 33 populations. To study whether differential field emergence was a cause of the segregation distortion, three near isogenic line (NIL) populations segregating at the rhg1 locus for SCN resistance from plant introduction 88788 were tested. Population sizes ranged from 32 to 44 NILs and emergence was determined in field experiments in three environments. In each population, SCN-resistant NILs had significantly (P < 0.05) less field emergence than susceptible NILs. In the population with the greatest effect, field emergence of resistant NILs was 6% less than susceptible NILs, with the entire population having an average emergence rate of 46%. Equations were derived to describe the effect of selection on segregation ratios over generations of population development and the observed emergence rates were transformed into fitness factors. Depending on assumptions of gene action, it was predicted from these fitness factors that segregation distortions were in the range of those reported previously for the rhg1 locus and were similar to what was observed on average across the 51 F-4 populations. While other factors might also be involved, the results suggest that reduced field emergence associated with the SCN resistance allele contributes to previously reported segregation distortion at the rhg1 locus.},

	Abstract = {Two pectate lyase genes (Bx-pel-1 and Bx-pel-2) were cloned from the pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The deduced amino acid sequences of these pectate lyases are most similar to polysaccharide lyase family 3 proteins. Recombinant BxPEL1 showed highest activity on polygalacturonic acid and lower activity on more highly methylated pectin. Recombinant BxPEL1 demonstrated full dependency on Ca2+ for activity and optimal activity at 55 degrees C and pH 8 to 10 like other pectate lyases of polysaccharide lyase family 3. The protein sequences have predicted signal peptides at their N-termini and the genes are expressed solely in the esophageal gland cells of the nematode, indicating that the pectate lyases could be secreted into plant tissues to help feeding and migration in the tree. This study suggests that pectate Iyases are widely distributed in plant-parasitic nematodes and play an important role in plant-nematode interactions.},

	Abstract = {DNA marker maps based on single populations are the basis for gene, loci and genomic analyses. Individual maps can be integrated to produce composite maps with higher marker densities if shared marker orders are consistent. However, estimates of marker order in composite maps must include sets of markers that were not polymorphic in multiple populations. Often some of the pooled markers were not codominant, or were not correctly scored. The soybean composite map was composed of data from five separate populations based on northern US germplasm but does not yet include 'Essex' by 'Forrest' recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (E x F) or any southern US soybean cultivars. The objectives were, to update the E x F map with codominant markers, to compare marker orders among this map, the Forrest physical map and the composite soybean map and to compare QTL identified by composite interval maps to the earlier interval maps. Two hundred and thirty seven markers were used to construct the core of the E x F map. The majority of marker orders were consistent between the maps. However, 19 putative marker inversions were detected on 12 of 20 linkage groups (LG). Eleven marker distance compressions were also found. The number of inverted markers ranged from 1 to 2 per LG. Thus, marker order inversions may be common in southern compared to northern US germplasm. A total of 61 QTL among 37 measures of six traits were detected by composite interval maps, interval maps and single point analysis. Seventeen of the QTL found in composite intervals had previously been detected among the 29 QTL found in simple interval maps. The genomic locations of the known QTL were more closely delimited. A genome sequencing project to compare Southern and Northern US soybean cultivars would catalog and delimit inverted regions and the associated QTL. Gene introgression in cultivar development programs would be accelerated.},

When resistance genes from exotic sources are transferred into elite cultivars, deleterious alleles are frequently transferred with resistance through genetic linkages. Two SCN resistance loci have been identified in G. soja Sieb. and Zucc. PI 468916, and the effect these loci have on yield and other agronomic traits is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of each G. soja SCN resistance gene on yield and other agronomic traits in elite soybean backgrounds. These effects were tested in two populations each segregating for SCN resistance derived from G. soja, with one population also segregating for the SCN resistance loci, rhg1, derived from G. max PI 88788. Each population was analyzed for genetic markers linked to the SCN resistance loci and field tested in multiple environments with low to high SCN infestations. The G. soja and rhg1 SCN resistance alleles either had no effect or significantly (PG. soja SCN resistance loci will increase the genetic diversity for SCN resistance and will provide breeders with an alternative source of SCN resistance that is not associated with reduced yield.},

	Abstract = {Numerous nodule-specific genes, which are involved in the root nodule development and function, have been known and are still being discovered. Here, we reported the structure, expression, and genetic map location of two novel nodule-specific genes. First, two EST groups, one obtained from a nodule library and the other from all aboveground tissue libraries, were clustered with regard to in silico expression profiles. We compiled a pool of 103 putative nodule-specific sequence clusters. Then, two representative ESTs were selected for further experimental analyses. According to the full-length cDNA sequences, one was an EST of a novel nodule-specific polygalacturonase gene, GmPGN, and the other was an EST of a new short nodule-specific gene, GmEKN. The results of expression analyses of the GmPGNcDNAs indicated that GmPGN expression was not detectable in any of the soybean tissues except in the nodule tissue and may be regulated via alternative splicing. GmEKN expression was the most strongly detected in the nodule. The predicted GmEKN protein is both glutamic acid- and lysine-rich, and is also highly hydrophilic. Genetic mapping located GmPGN near the known quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to soybean cyst nematode on soybean molecular linkage group (MLG) B 1, and GmEKAI on MLG A2. These results provide useful information for the use of these genes in research on the orchestration of numerous genes in nodule development and function. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis on pooled data from multiple populations (pooled analysis) provides a means for evaluating, as a whole, evidence for existence of a QTL from different studies and examining differences in gene effect of a QTL among different populations. Objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a method for pooled analysis and (2) conduct pooled analysis on data from two soybean mapping populations. Least square interval mapping was extended for pooled analysis by inclusion of populations and cofactor markers as indicator variables and covariate variables separately in the multiple linear models. The general linear test approach was applied for detecting a QTL. Single population-based and pooled analyses were conducted on data from two F-2:3 mapping populations, Hamilton (susceptible) x PI 90763 (resistant) and Magellan (susceptible) x PI 404198A (resistant), for resistance to soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in soybean. It was demonstrated that where a QTL was shared among populations, pooled analysis showed increased LOD values on the QTL candidate region over single population analyses. Where a QTL was not shared among populations, however, the pooled analysis showed decreased LOD values on the QTL candidate region over single population analyses. Pooled analysis on data from genetically similar populations may have higher power of QTL detection than single population-based analyses. QTLs were identified by pooled analysis on linkage groups (LGs) G, B1 and J for resistance to SCN race 2 whereas QTLs on LGs G, B1 and E for resistance to SCN race 5 in soybean PI 90763 and PI 404198A. QTLs on LG G and B1 were identified in both PI 90763 and PI 404198A whereas QTLs on LG E and J were identified in PI 90763 only. QTLs on LGs G and B1 for resistance to race 2 may be the same or closely linked with QTLs on LG G and B1 for resistance to race 5, respectively. It was further demonstrated that QTLs on G and B1 carried by PI 90763 were not significantly different in gene effect from QTLs on LGs G and B1 in PI 404198A, respectively.},

Soybean plant introduction (PI) 404198A is one of the newly identified sources that can provide a broad spectrum of resistance to SCN. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to SCN races 1, 2, and 5 in PI 404198A. Linkage groups (LGs) G and A2 were found to be associated with resistance to race 1. QTL on LG G was located on the Satt309-Satt688 region, and it explained a larger proportion of the total variation (20.2%). QTL on LG A2 was located at the Satt424-Saff632-Sat_406 region, and it accounted for a smaller proportion (9%). LGs G and III were shown to be associated with resistance to race 2. QTL on LG G was located on the Satt688-Satt309-Satt163 region, and it explained 12.5% of the total variation. Molecular marker Satt453 on LG B1 was found to be associated with resistance to race 2, and it explained 11% of the total variation. LGs G, 111, and N were found to be associated with resistance to race 5. QTL on LG G was located on the Satt688Satt309-Satt163 region, and it explained 6.3% of the total variation. Molecular marker Satt453 on LG 131 was found to be associated with resistance to race 5, and it explained a larger proportion of the total variation (13%). QTL on LG N was mapped on the Satt584-Sat_280Satt549, and it explained 9.5% of the total variation. In conclusion, soybean PI 404198A may carry rhg1 on LG G, Rhg4 on LG A2, and a QTL on LG B1.

Other chemical compounds like sterols and lipids have also been recognized as signaling molecules in plants, but it was only recently discovered that peptides in plants, as in animal cells, play crucial roles in various aspects of growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and self/non-self recognition in sporophytic self-incompatibility. These peptides are often part of a very large gene family whose members show diverse, sometime overlapping spatial and temporal expression patterns, allowing them to regulate different aspects of plant growth and development. Only a handful of peptides have been linked to a bona fide receptor, thereby activating a cascade of events. Since these peptides have been thoroughly reviewed in the past few years, this review will focus on the small putative plant signaling peptides, some often disregarded in the plant peptide literature, which have been shown through biochemical or genetic studies to play important roles in plants.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is one of the most economically damaging pests of soybean. The damage can only be effectively controlled through the use of resistant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars. Since QTL mapping is a highly effective approach for studying genetically complex forms of plant resistance to pests, it should be used to identify and map QTLs for resistance to SCN from various genetic backgrounds. The objective of the present study was to identify closely linked DNA markers to QTLs for resistance to SCN race 3 in the cultivar Toyomusume derived from a resistant cultivar Gedenshirazu, using the AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) method combined with bulked segregant analysis (BSA). A population of 115 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of Toyomusume (resistant) and Tsurukogane (susceptible) was used to map QTLs related to the resistance to SCN race 3. After genotyping of all the RILs with molecular markers including AFLP, RFLP, SSR and RAPD markers, composite interval mapping was performed for QTL analysis. In addition to known rhg1 on the linkage group (LG) G, two significant QTLs, rhg-t1 and rhg-t2, on the linkage group B1 near the AFLP markers CAT_CTC1 and GTC_ATT, respectively, were identified using two experimental assays. Epistatic analysis suggested that the combination of rhg1 and rhg-t1 could provide a higher level of resistance to SCN race 3, compared to any single QTL. The AFLP markers surrounding rhg1 and rhg-t1 could be used for marker-assisted selection of SCN resistance derived from Gedenshirazu, when converted to PCR-based markers.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines (SCN) is of major economic importance and widely distributed throughout soybean production regions of the United States where different maturity groups with the same sources of SCN resistance are grown. The objective of this study was to assess SCN-resistant and -susceptible soybean yield responses in infested soils across the north-central region. In 1994 and 1995, eight SCN-resistant and eight SCN-susceptible public soybean cultivars representing maturity groups (MG) I to IV were planted in 63 fields, either infested or noninfested, in 10 states in the north-central United States. Soil samples were taken to determine initial SCN population density and race, and soil classification. Data were grouped for analysis by adaptation based on MG zones. Soybean yields were 658 to 3,840 kg/ha across the sites. Soybean cyst nematode-resistant cultivars yielded better at SCN-infested sites but lost this superiority to susceptible soybean cultivars at noninfested sites. Interactions were observed among initial SCN population density, cultivar, and location. This study showed that no region-wide predictive equations could be developed for yield loss based on initial nematode populations in the soil and that yield loss due to SCN in our region was greatly confounded by other stress factors, which included temperature and moisture extremes.},

	Abstract = {Fifty-five soybean cyst nematode (SCN)-infested production fields across Indiana were surveyed in March 2004 to assess broadleaf winter weed prevalence. The most frequently occurring weeds were common chickweed (87%), speedwell (83%), buttercup (58%), and henbit (53%). Henbit and wild garlic were present at the highest average densities, both occurring at greater than 50 plants/m(2). Based on relative abundance indices, common chickweed and henbit were the most prevalent winter weeds in this survey. As a composite, winter weed hosts of SCN were found in 93% of fields and occurred at an average density of 151 plants/m(2). No correlation existed between weed density and SCN egg counts. Frequency, uniformity, density, and diversity indices for individual weed species were generally higher in the southern region of Indiana than in the north. Thus, the region of highest risk for SCN reproduction and population increase on winter weeds in Indiana appears to be in the southern part of the state.},

	Abstract = {Soyabean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; HG) is one of the most destructive pests of soyabean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in the United States. Over 100 SCN-resistant accessions within the USDA Soyabean Germplasm Collection have been identified, but little is known about the genetic diversity of this SCN-resistant germplasm. The objective of this research was to evaluate the genetic variation and determine the genetic relationships among SCN-resistant accessions. One hundred twenty-two genotypes were evaluated by 85 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from 20 linkage groups. Non-hierarchical (VARCLUS) and hierarchical (Ward's) clustering were combined with multidimensional scaling (MDS) to determine relationships among tested lines. The 85 SSR markers produced 566 allelic fragments with a mean polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.35. The 122 lines were grouped into 7 clusters by 2 different clustering methods and the MDS results consistently corresponded to the assigned clusters. Assigned clusters were dominated by genotypes that possess one or more unique SCN resistance genes and were associated with geographical origins. The results of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the variation differences among clusters and individual lines were significant, but the differences among individuals within clusters were not significant.},

	Abstract = {The effects of alfalfa, red clover, and perennial ryegrass as cover crops on soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and soybean and corn yields were evaluated in Waseca, Lamberton, and Rosemount, MN. The cover crops were interseeded in soybean at 0 or 2 wks after planting soybean in 2002 and killed with herbicide before planting corn in 2003. As expected, SCN-susceptible soybean supported higher SCN population density than SCN-resistant soybean. Reduction of SCN population density by red clover (up to 40%) and alfalfa (up to 55%) was observed in some sampling occasions at Lamberton and Rosemount, probably due to reduced soybean growth, but the effect was inconsistent. No significant reduction of SCN population by the two crops was detected at Waseca. While perennial ryegrass did not affect SCN population density in most cases, up to 46% higher egg population densities were observed in the perennial ryegrass treatment as compared to the control at Waseca. SCN-resistant soybean produced higher yield than susceptible soybean at all sites. While alfalfa reduced soybean yield at Lamberton (up to 50%) and Rosemount (up to 11%), red clover and perennial ryegrass reduced soybean yield only at Lamberton (up to 38%) and Waseca (up to 34%), respectively. No difference in corn yield was observed at Waseca. At Lamberton, alfalfa and red clover planted at the time of planting soybean reduced corn yield in the following year 17 and 13%, respectively, and perennial ryegrass planted 2 wks after planting soybean reduced corn yield 13%. At Rosemount, significant reduction of corn yield was observed with red clover (15-21%) interseeded in SCN-susceptible soybean and with alfalfa (12%) and red clover (12%) interseeded in SCN-resistant soybean at the time of planting soybean. The results suggest that an even later planting date of cover crops in soybean may reduce yield loss due to competition and make these cover crops more appropriate for use in the soybean-corn rotation in Minnesota.},

	Abstract = {Resistant responses to cyst nematode infection can take several different forms at a cytological level. We recently identified several new sources of resistance to Globodera pallida, including one derived from S. canasense Hawkes. Here we examine invasion, migration, syncytium formation and development of G. pallida on this source as compared with a susceptible cultivar (Desiree). Nematodes located roots of both resistant and Susceptible plants, and invasion, migration and syncytium development occurred as expected on cv. Desiree roots. By contrast, second-stage juveniles (J2) invading S. canasense roots rarely induced a functional syncytium. The few syncytia that were induced were markedly smaller than those observed in cv. Desiree roots at the same time-point, although they did contain the enlarged nuclei characteristic of 'normal' syncytia. No evidence for a necrotic response to the nematode or a developing syncytium was observed in S. canasense roots that did not support syncytia. Second-stage juveniles were observed at the surface of these roots suggesting that the nematodes were either unable to invade S. canasense roots or, as is the case for other resistance sources, that the J2 left the root soon after invasion. The possibility that glycoalkaloids play a role in the resistance of S. canasense to G. pallida is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The epidermis of the anterior end (nose) plays an important role in the evolution, development, and functional feeding morphology in nematodes, but information on this complex organ system is limited. Here, we produce a 3D model of 13 of the cells making up this organ system reconstructed from serial transmission electron micrographs of the microbial feeding nematode, Acrobeles complexus. Nose epidermal cells were found to be broadly similar to those of the distantly related model organism Caenorhabditis elegans in the number and arrangement of nuclei in these largely syncytial cells; this similarity demonstrates striking evolutionary conservation that allows for robust statements of homology between the taxa. Examining details of cell shape, however, revealed surprisingly complex subcellular specialization, which differed markedly from C. elegans in the number and arrangement of cell processes. Anterior toroid processes of the anterior arcade, posterior arcade, and HypB syncytia form a nested complex at the base of the labial probolae. Anterior toroid processes of HypC and the inner labial socket cells are associated with the base of the cephalic probolae and radial ridge processes. Extracellular filaments (tendon organs) and radiating cytoskeletal. filaments of the posterior arcade syncytium form a connection between the body wall muscle cells and the pharynx. An epidermal cell with no known homolog in other nematodes is identified. Findings provide a basis to propose hypotheses related to the development and evolutionary origin of specialized feeding appendages (probolae) in the Cephalobinae (including Acrobeles), and hypotheses of homology are revised for epidermal cells in the nose of the closely related and primarily plant parasitic group.},

	Abstract = {Ethylene controls many beneficial responses in plants but also promotes chlorosis, senescence, disease, and fruit over-ripening. The present study compared previously isolated ethylene-insensitive lines of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] to their isogenic, ethylene-sensitive parent with respect to disease resistance, seed yield, and other field performance traits. In laboratory tests, ethylene insensitivity reduced root colonization by soybean cyst nematode. Using healthy young plants, ethylene-insensitivity also reduced ethylene-activated leaf chlorosis and abscission. However, in the field, leaf chlorophyll and late-season senescence were not altered, suggesting that ethylene is not a main determinant of late-season senescence of soybean leaves. Field studies also revealed no changes in susceptibility to Septoria brown spot disease (caused by Septoria glycines Hemmi), flowering date, plant height, or seed total protein and oil concentration. Field studies did demonstrate elevated susceptibility to white mold disease [Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) deBary], poor stand establishment in some but not all environments, altered plant architecture, and earlier maturity date in the ethylene-insensitive lines. Seed yield was notably undependable, being similar to the parental line in some field locations but significantly reduced in most environments. To avoid these negative impacts on overall performance, manipulation of plant ethylene responses should be targeted to specific tissues, growth stages, or growth environments.},

Replicate, independent biological samples were examined at each time point. Gene expression was analyzed statistically using T-tests, ANOVA, clustering algorithms, and online analytical processing (OLAP). These analyses allow the user to query the data in several ways without importing the data into third-party software. RT-PCR confirmed that WRKY6 transcription factor, trehalose phosphate synthase, EIF4a, Skp1, and CLB1 were differentially induced across most time-points. Other genes induced across most timepoints included lipoxygenase, calmodulin, phospholipase C, metallothionein-like protein, and chalcone reductase. RT-PCR demonstrated enhanced expression during the first 12 h of infection for Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and sucrose synthase. The stress-related gene, SAM-22, phospholipase D and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase were also induced at the early time-points. At 6 and 8 dpi there was an abundance of transcripts expressed that encoded genes involved in transcription and protein synthesis. Some of those genes included ribosomal proteins, and initiation and elongation factors. Several genes involved in carbon metabolism and transport were also more abundant. Those genes included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and sucrose synthase. These results identified specific changes in gene transcript levels triggered by infection of susceptible soybean roots by SCN.},

N-Viro Soil from different locations, the components of NVS (de-watered biosolids and fly ash admixtures), and sterilized NVS were applied to sand microcosms to determine effects on nematode survival sand Solution pH and ammonia concentrations. This study confirmed the previous finding that an important mechanism of Heterodera glycines suppression by NVS was the generation of alkaline soil conditions. Only the fly ash admixture that resulted in an increase in pH to 10.0 suppressed H. glycines to the same level as NVS. Alkaline-stabilization of biosolids was necessary to achieve nematode suppression. Biosolids applied at rates <3% dry w/w did not suppress H. glycines to the same level as equivalent amounts of NVS. Sand solution pH levels after biosolid application, regardless of rate, were approximately 8.5 whereas 1% and 4% w/w NVS amendment resulted in pH levels of 10.3 and 11.6, respectively. NVS from different processing facilities were all effective in suppressing H. glycives. The NVS source that produced the highest concentration of ammonia did not reduce H. glycines survival to the same level as those sources generating pH levels above 10.1. Microbes associated with NVS appeared not to be responsible for the nematode suppressiverress of the amendment; there was no difference in nematode Suppression between atnoclaved and nonautoclaved NVS. The role that ammonia plays in the Suppression of H. glycines by NVS is still unclear.},

Suppressive soils prevent nematodes from establishing and from causing disease, and they diminish disease severity after initial nematode damage in continuous Culturing of a host. A range of non-specific and specific soil treatments, followed by infestation with a target nematode, have been employed to identify nematode-suppressive soils. Biocidal treatments, soil transfer tests, and baiting approaches together with observations of the plant-parasitic nematode in the root zone of susceptible host plants have improved the understanding of nematode-suppressive soils. Techniques to demonstrate specific soil suppressiveness against plant-parasitic nematodes are compared in this review. The overlap Of Studies on soil suppressiveness with recent advances in soil health and quality is briefly discussed. The emphasis is on methods (or criteria) used to detect and identify soils that maintain specific soil suppressiveness to plant-parasitic nematodes. While biocidal treatments can detect general and specific soil suppressiveness, soil transfer studies, by definition, apply only to specific soil suppressiveness. Finally, potential strategies to exploit suppressive soils are presented.},

	Abstract = {The Hg-SYV46 parasitism gene is expressed exclusively in the dorsal oesophageal gland cell of parasitic stages of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, and it encodes a secretory protein that contains a C-terminal motif of the CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) family in Arabidopsis thaliana. in shoot and floral meristems of Arabidopsis, the stem cells secret CLV3, a founding member of the CLE protein family, that activates the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex and negatively regulates WUSCHEL expression to restrict the size of the stem cell population. Mis-expression of Hg-SYV46 in Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia-0) under control of the CaMV35S promoter resulted in a wus-like phenotype including premature termination of the shoot apical meristem and the development of flowers lacking the central gynoecium. The wus-like phenotype observed was similar to reports of over-expression of CLV3 and CLE40 in Arabidopsis, as was down-regulation of WUS expression in the shoot apices of 355::Hg-SYV46/Col-0 plants. Expression of 35S::Hg-SYV46 in a clv3-1 mutant of Arabidopsis was able partially or fully to rescue the mutant phenotype, probably dependent upon localization and level of transgene expression. A short root phenotype, as reported for overexpression of CLV3, CLE40 and CLE19 in roots, was also produced in primary 35S::Hg-SYV46/Col-0 transgenic plants. The results suggest a functional similarity of HG-SYV46 to plant-secreted CLE ligands that may play a role in the differentiation or division of feeding cells induced in plant roots by parasitic nematodes.},

The availability of high-throughput and inexpensive SNP typing systems has increased interest in the development of SNP markers. After fragments of genes were amplified with primers derived from 110 soybean GenBank ESTs, sequencing data of PCR products from 15 soybean genotypes from Korea and the United States were analyzed by SeqScape software to find SNPs. Among 35 gene fragments with at least one SNP among the 15 genotypes, SNPs occurred at a frequency of 1 per 2,038 bp in 16,302 bp of coding sequence and 1 per 191 bp in 16,960 bp of noncoding regions. This corresponds to a nucleotide diversity (theta) of 0.00017 and 0.00186, respectively. Of the 97 SNPs discovered, 78 or 80.4% were present in the six North American soybean mapping parents. The addition of "Hwaeomputkong," which originated from Japan, increased the number to 92, or 94.8% of the total number of SNPs present among the 15 genotypes. Thus, Hwaeomputkong and the six North American mapping parents provide a diverse set of soybean genotypes that can be successfully used for SNP discovery in coding DNA and closely associated introns and untranslated regions.},

	Abstract = {Weeds are alternative hosts for plant-parasitic nematodes and have long been recognized for their ability to maintain nematode populations targeted for suppression by various management strategies. The impact of weeds as alternative hosts depends largely on nematode feeding behavior, which is determined by the level of host specialization required for the parasite to feed successfully. In general, the more specialized feeding adaptations are associated with greater crop damage, more diverse nematode management options, and greater negative impact from weeds. Besides serving as alternative hosts, certain weeds can protect nematodes from pesticides and the environment, provide nematode suppression through antagonism, contribute to changes in future nematode biotic potential, or exert indirect effects through competition with crops or by the effects of weed control strategies on nematode populations. Shrinking nematicide options and increasing environmental concerns are making integrated pest management (IPM) a necessity for nematode management in many crops. A prominent similarity between most major weeds and plant-parasitic nematodes is that both are place-bound organisms that are passively dispersed. Weed-nematode interactions in agricultural production systems may be more intricate and complex than the simple function of weeds as alternative hosts. Their relationship may represent a normal adaptation resulting from the limited mobility of both groups of organisms and the obligate parasitism of phytophagous nematodes. The challenge that faces weed scientists and nematologists is to identify effective, compatible IPM strategies that address weed and nematode management collectively.},

	Abstract = {Isoflavones are thought to play diverse roles in plant-microbe interactions and are also potentially important to human nutrition and medicine. Isoflavone synthase (IFS) is a key enzyme for the formation of the isoflavones. Here, we examined the consequences of RNAi silencing of genes for this enzyme in soybean (Glycine max). Soybean cotyledon tissues were transformed with Agrobacterium rhizogenes carrying an RNAi silencing construct designed to silence expression of both copies of IFS genes. Approximately 50% of emerging roots were transformed with the RNAi construct, and most transformed roots exhibited > 95% silencing of isoflavone accumulation. Silencing of IFS was also demonstrated throughout the entire cotyledon (in tissues distal to the transformation site) both by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of isoflavones and by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. This distal silencing led to a nearly complete suppression of mRNA accumulation for both the IFS1 and IFS2 genes and of isoflavone accumulations induced by wounding or treatment with the cell wall glucan elicitor from Phytophthora sojae. Preformed isoflavone conjugates were not reduced in distal tissues, suggesting little turnover of these stored isoflavone pools. Distal silencing was established within just 5 d of transformation and was highly efficient for a 3- to 4-d period, after which it was no longer apparent in most experiments. Silencing of IFS was effective in at least two genotypes and led to enhanced susceptibility to P. sojae, disrupting both R gene-mediated resistance in roots and nonrace-specific resistance in cotyledon tissues. The soybean cotyledon system, already a model system for defense signal-response and cell-to-cell signaling, may provide a convenient and effective system for functional analysis of plant genes through gene silencing.},

We examined the effect of geldanamycin on egg hatch and juvenile motility in Caenorhabditis elegans and in two populations of the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines. When C. elegans eggs were exposed to geldanamycin, both hatch and motility were reduced by GA doses between 2 and 50 mu g/ml. The H. glycines inbred populations TN17 and TN18 exhibited low dose stimulation of hatch and motility, whereas levels occurring at higher GA doses were at or below control levels. These experiments represent the first demonstration of geldanamycin effects in C. elegans and H. glycines and suggest that the heat shock chaperone Hsp90, the known molecular target of geldanamycin, may be involved in nematode egg hatch and motility. This study also indicates that geldanamycin-producing strains of Streptomyces may be useful as biocontrol agents for nematodes.},

Our multiple-gene approach is based on sampling more than 80,000 publicly available tylenchid EST sequences to identify phylum-wide orthologues. Bayesian inference, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood and protein distance methods were employed for phylogenetic reconstruction and hypothesis tests were constructed to elucidate differential selective pressures across the phylogeny for each gene. Our results place M. incognita and M. javanica as sister taxa, with M. arenaria as the next closely related nematode. Significant differences in selective pressure were revealed for some genes under some hypotheses, though all but one gene are exclusively under purifying selection, indicating conservation across the orthologous groups.

The objectives of our research were to map and localize BSR resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) from Bell, a BSR resistant cultivar with SCN resistance from PI 88788. Initial mapping was done with a population of 93 F4-derived lines developed from a cross between Bell and the SCN and BSR susceptible cultivar, Colfax. Lines were evaluated for BSR resistance in two field environments, a greenhouse, and with genetic markers from linkage group (LG) J. To confirm and further localize a resistance QTL, three near isogenic line (NIL) populations were created using an F4-derived line from the Bell x Colfax population. In the F4 population, markers on LG J were significantly (PR2=45%) and greenhouse (R2=51%). Data from the NIL populations indicates the QTL is near the closely linked markers 21E22.sp1, 21E22.sp2, and 35E22.sp1, which is the same genetic region where Rbs1, Rbs2, and Rbs3, the three named BSR resistance genes, were previously mapped. In addition, the genetic region is tightly linked to a previously identified SCN resistance QTL from PI 88788. These results explain why many SCN resistant cultivars also carry BSR resistance and should assist breeders when selecting for resistance to both diseases.},

However, root-knot nematode reproduction was lower in pots that received a halosulfuron treatment, particularly halosulfuron applied 2 wk after inoculation.

	Abstract = {Background: Recent genome sequencing enables mega-base scale comparisons between related genomes. Comparisons between animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria demonstrate extensive synteny tempered by rearrangements. Within the legume plant family, glimpses of synteny have also been observed. Characterizing syntenic relationships in legumes is important in transferring knowledge from model legumes to crops that are important sources of protein, fixed nitrogen, and health-promoting compounds. Results: We have uncovered two large soybean regions exhibiting synteny with M. truncatula and with a network of segmentally duplicated regions in Arabidopsis. In all, syntenic regions comprise over 500 predicted genes spanning 3 Mb. Up to 75% of soybean genes are colinear with M. truncatula, including one region in which 33 of 35 soybean predicted genes with database support are colinear to M. truncatula. In some regions, 60% of soybean genes share colinearity with a network of A. thaliana duplications. One region is especially interesting because this 500 kbp segment of soybean is syntenic to two paralogous regions in M. truncatula on different chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis of individual genes within these regions demonstrates that one is orthologous to the soybean region, with which it also shows substantially denser synteny and significantly lower levels of synonymous nucleotide substitutions. The other M. truncatula region is inferred to be paralogous, presumably resulting from a duplication event preceding speciation. Conclusion: The presence of well-defined M. truncatula segments showing orthologous and paralogous relationships with soybean allows us to explore the evolution of contiguous genomic regions in the context of ancient genome duplication and speciation events.},

Application of 3% NVS (dry weight amendment/dry weight soil) in the soil mixture resulted in significant (P <= 0.01) suppression of RKN egg numbers on cantaloupe roots compared to all other treatments, including 1% NVS and untreated controls. Ammonia accumulation was higher with the 3% NVS amendment than with any other treatment. Adjustment of soil pH with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] to the same levels that resulted from NVS amendment did not suppress nematode populations. When cultured in yeast-malt extract broth and particularly in nutrient broth, S 99-60 was capable of producing a compound(s) that reduced RKN egg hatch and activity of second-stage juveniles. However, when this isolate was applied to soil and to seedling roots, no suppression of RKN egg populations was observed on cantaloupe roots. Combining S 99-60 with NVS or Ca(OH)(2) did not result in enhanced nematode suppression compared to treatments applied individually. The results indicated that NVS application was effective at suppressing RKN populations through the accumulation of ammonia to levels lethal to the nematode in soil.},

The plant-parasitic nematodes Heterodera glycines, Meloidogyne incognita and Pratylenchus zeae and the free-living nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Panagrellus redivivus were placed on colonies of M. drechsleri grown in Petri dishes to study ability of the isolate to trap various nematode hosts. None of the nematodes placed near adhesive knobs were motile within 1 d. To determine where M. drechsleri fits within the existing phylogeny of nematode-trapping fungi, the ITS1-ITS2 regions of rDNA and the nuclear gene EF1-alpha were sequenced for the new isolate of M. drechsleri, for the species M. parvicolle and M. lysipagum, and for an isolate of M. ellipsosporum distinct from the one listed in GenBank. Parsimony trees were constructed showing the closest molecular relative of M. drechsleri to be the newly sequenced isolate of M. ellipsosporum; the latter had a highly divergent sequence from the sequence recorded in GenBank for a different isolate of M. ellipsosporum. Unique, consistent and discrete morphological characters are absent in these related taxa, so an independent molecular character should be considered essential for their accurate identification.},

Healthy cysts obtained from mass culture in a growing chamber were placed on fungal colonies already formed in Petri dishes. The highest infection rate was observed 10 days after inoculation and reached 72%. Fusarium oxysporum also had the ability to penetrate through cysts wall. The effects of spore suspensions of Fusarium on H. cruciferae in cabbage plants were tested in pot experiments in growth chambers. Cabbages cyst nematode (CCN) eggs were first incubated in a fungal spore suspension (10(8)-10(9) spores/ml) for 5 min and then introduced into pots containing sterilized soil and 3-weeks-old healthy cabbage plants. A positive effect was observed on plant height, fresh weight, fresh root weight, length and leaf area. Nematode numbers in the root system decreased within 2 months after artificial inoculations with Fusarium-infected cysts. This suggests a negative, antagonistic effect between F. oxysporum and H. cruciferae.},

However, developing new H. glycines-resistant soybean cultivars is a very labor-intensive process, partially due to the lack of a quick method for counting the H. glycines females that develop on soybean roots. We have developed a fluorescence image-based system for counting females on excised seedling roots cultured on nutrient media in petri dishes. In this system, the females fluoresced when exposed to a wavelenght of 570 nm. The fluorescent images were captured with a digital camera, transfered to a computer, and displayed on a monitor. The image of an entire sample was viewed at once, and the fluorescing females were counted manually. This system significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of counting females developed on cultured seedling roots compared to a microscope counting method. The potential for applications in the screening of nematode-resistant crops is discussed.},

In this study, the potential of liquid cultures of the two fungi was evaluated in two glasshouse experiments. Both liquid culture at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 g of fresh mycelium/300 cm(3) Soil (per pot) and solid culture at 1% (corn grits: soil, w/w) reduced nematode egg population densities in both autoclaved and unheated soils as compared with soil-only control or corn-grits control. However, the liquid culture at 0.2-0.8 g of mycelium/pot appeared to be more effective in reducing the nematode population than the solid culture of 1%. Hirsutella rhossiliensis resulted in lower nematode population density than H. minnesotensis only in unheated soil in one experiment. The soil heat treatment generally increased the nematode population density but did not affect percentage reduction of the nematode population density as compared with respective controls, except that reduction by H. rhossiliensis was greater in unheated soil than heat-treated soil in one experiment. Percentage of second-stage juveniles (J2) parasitised by fungi at the end of the experiment (60 days after planting) was generally higher with H. minnesotensis than with H. rhossiliensis. The percentage parasitism was positively correlated with initial fungal inoculation level. The soil heat treatment increased fungal parasitism in one experiment but not in the other. Plant growth was unaffected by treatments except that the soil heat treatment increased plant shoot weight as compared with unheated soil in one experiment.},

	Abstract = {Root exudates from transgenic potato plants expressing a chemoreception-disruptive peptide inhibit acetylcholinesterase by up to 63 +/- 3%. This inhibition correlates strongly with the efficacy of the exudates as a presoak solution for infective juveniles of Heterodera glycines that leads to reduced root invasion. The establishment of developing Globodera pallida at 21 days post-infection in these transgenic plants was also suppressed in containment trials. Relative to controls, the best line showed a 47 +/- 5% reduction in developing females and had 188 +/- 25% more undeveloped infective juveniles. This suggests that disorientation of chemoreception occurs after initial root invasion. Line (e) showed the highest level of resistance with 61 +/- 4% in glasshouse trials conducted over a 9-week period. This result represents the combined effect on the number of cysts produced and the number of eggs each cyst contains. The level of control shown to saccate females was consistent in both the 21-day and 9-week post-infection studies. Another chemoreception-disruptive peptide, that binds to nematode nicotinic receptors in cholinergic neurones, provided a 52.6 +/- 1% reduction in the number of nematodes able to establish in transgenic hairy roots that expressed the peptide. This confirms that both chemoreception-disruptive peptides have efficacy in suppressing parasitism by cyst nematodes when expressed in planta at low concentrations.},

	Abstract = {An aminopeptidase full-length cDNA (Hg-amp-1) was cloned from the adult female soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines by heterologous screening of a cDNA library with a Caenorhabditis elegans EST sequence. The predicted open reading frame encoded an 882-amino acid protein containing the conserved zinc-binding domain and GAMEN motif that are characteristic of M I family aminopeptidases. The putative protein lacks any subcellular targeting signals and displays strong similarity to puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidases from C elegans, Drosophila and mammals. Hg-amp-1 is expressed in juvenile nematodes and both male and female adults, with highest expression in gravid females. In situ mRNA hybridisation localised the Hg-amp-1 transcript to the genital primordium of pre-parasitic juvenile nematodes and the reproductive tract of adult females. Suppression of Hg-amp-1 transcript level by RNA-interference led to a 61% reduction in the number of female nematodes parasitising soybean roots 21 days post infection with infective juvenile nematodes that had been exposed to double-stranded RNA.

Host range: Cyst nematodes comprise approximately 100 known species in six genera. They are pathogens of temperate, subtropical and tropical plant species and the host range of many species is narrow. The most economically important species are within the Globodera and Heterodera genera. Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis are important pathogens of potato crops. There are many economic species in the Heterodera genus, including Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode), H. avenae (cereal cyst nematode) and H. schachtii (sugar beet cyst nematode), the last of which attacks a range of Chenopodiaceae and Cruciferae, including Arabidopsis thaliana. Disease symptoms: Field symptoms of severe cyst nematode infection are often stunting, wilting and chlorosis, but considerable yield loss can occur without obvious symptoms. The only unique indicator of cyst nematode infection is the presence of adult female nematodes attached to host roots after several weeks of parasitism. Disease control: This is usually achieved by using integrated pest management involving cultural practices such as crop rotation, resistant cultivars if available and chemical control when economically justified.},

	Abstract = {The effect of the rhg1 gene on equilibrium population densities (E) and reproduction factors (Rf) of Heterodera glycines was studied by comparing the nematode population development on two near-isogenic soybean lines (NIL), differing at the rhg1 locus. The NIL were inoculated with a series of initial egg densities (Pi) in the greenhouse. The relationships between final population densities (Pf= females per plant or eggs per plant) or Rf (final egg density/Pi) on both NIL and Pi were adequately described by quadratic models. The rhg1 gene suppressed Pf and Rf at all Pi of a population of H. glycines race 3 (HG Type 0-); E and maximum Rf were higher on the NIL-S line than on the NIL-R line. After two generations of culture of the race 3 population on the NIL-R line, the population selected by the rhg1 gene (R-eggs) had higher Pf and Rf on the NIL-R line than the population cultured on the NIL-S line (S-eggs) at all Pi. Both R-eggs and S-eggs produced similar egg numbers on the NIL-S line, which was higher than the egg number of either population on the NIL-R line at all Pi. The ratio of E in female numbers on the NIL-R line to E on the NIL-S line increased from 29% for the original race 3 population (S-eggs) to 46% for the rhg1-selected population (R-eggs). Regardless of different egg sources, a trend of increase in the number of eggs per female with the rise of Pi was observed on the NIL-S line. In contrast, female fecundity of both populations declined with the increase of Pi on the NIL-R line. At most inoculum densities, the highest number of eggs per female was observed on the NIL-S line inoculated with the R-eggs, whereas the lowest number of eggs per female was detected on the NIL-R line inoculated with the S-eggs. This study demonstrated that the E and maximum Rf determined by the quadratic models are useful measurements of plant resistance to nematodes.},

At least 109 genes encoding over 250 potential neuropeptides have been identified in C. elegans; all genes are likely to be expressed and many, if not all, of the predicted peptides are produced. The predicted peptides include: 38 insulin-like peptides, several of which are involved in development and reproductive growth, and over 70 FMRFamide-related peptides, some of which are involved in locomotion, reproduction, and social behaviour. Many of the C. elegans peptides are identical or highly similar to those isolated or predicted in parasitic nematodes, Such as Ascaris suum, Haemonchus contortus, Ancylostoma caninum, Heterodera glycines and Meloidogyne arenaria, suggesting that the function of these peptides is similar across species. The challenge for the future is to determine the function of all the genes and individual peptides and to identify the receptors through which the peptides signal.},

	Abstract = {Farmer observations and previous studies indicated that reductions in soybean yield caused by the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) are greater when other stresses, biotic or abiotic, are present. Also, it has been reported that the effect of SCN on soybean growth depended on factors such as soil pH, soil texture, and herbicides. Although postemergence herbicides may adversely affect soybean metabolism, acifluorfen can reduce SCN infection. The objective of the present Study was to determine the main and interactive effects of SCN egg population density (SCND), soil pH, soil texture, and the application of the herbicides acifluorfen, glyphosate, and imazethapyr on early soybean growth. Greenhouse studies assessed different combinations of these factors for 65 d after planting. No interactions were observed for any of the main effects. Soil pH and texture did not affect soybean growth. SCN,, was the only main effect that explained soybean growth reductions. The effect of SCND on soybean growth was exhibited as 15-50% decreases of leaf area index (LAI) and dry weight in all cases, but reductions in plant height also were observed. No relationship between SCND and the number of SCN eggs recovered at the end of the experiment was observed. Herbicides did not reduce soybean growth, although acifluorfen consistently caused the highest soybean injury reaching 18-20% from 1-14 days after application (DAA). At 50 DAA, acifluorfen injury was negligible, and soybean LAI and dry weight did not differ from the nontreated control. These results indicated that the effect of SCN on soybean growth was not directly affected by the other evaluated main effects. Therefore, trends observed in the field that suggested interactions between those factors are likely the result of other factors not considered in the present study or to more complex relationships between factors analyzed in the present study and other elements present in the field.

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines is the most destructive pathogen of soybean in the Unites States. Diversity in the parasitic ability of the nematode allows it to reproduce on nematode-resistant soybean. H. glycines chorismate mutase-1 (Hg-CM-1) is a nematode enzyme with the potential to suppress host plant defense compounds; therefore, it has the potential to enhance the parasitic ability of nematodes expressing the gene. Hg-cm-1 is a member of a gene family where two alleles, Hg-cm-1A and Hg-cm-1B, have been identified. Analysis of the Hg-cm-1 gene copy number revealed that there are multiple copies of Hg-cm-1 alleles in the H. glycines genome. H. glycines inbred lines were crossed to ultimately generate three F2 populations of second-stage juveniles (J2s) segregating for Hg-em-1A and Hg-cm-1B. Segregation of Hg-cm-1A and 1B approximated a 1:2:1 ratio, which suggested that Hg-cm-1 is organized in a cluster of genes that segregate roughly as a single locus. The F-2 H. glycines J2 populations were used to infect nematode-resistant (Hartwig, P188788, and P190763) and susceptible (Lee 74) soybean plants. H. glycines grown on Hartwig, Lee 74, and P190763 showed allelic frequencies similar to Hg-cm-1A/B, but nematodes grown on P188788 contained predominately Hg-cm-1A allele as a result of a statistically significant drop of Hg-cm-1B in the population. This result suggests that specific Hg-cm-1 alleles, or a closely linked gene, may aid H. glycines in adapting to particular soybean hosts.},

The full-length messenger RNAs encoding actin were cloned and characterized from the plant-parasitic cyst nematodes Heterodera glycines and Globodera rostochiensis and from the free-living nematode Panagrellus redivivus. The actins from the plant-parasitic nematodes showed highest amino acid sequence identity to filarial nematode homologues, whereas nucleotide sequence identity was much lower than that for many actins from very distant organisms, such as vertebrates, plants, or fungi. Analysis of base composition revealed a striking difference between the H. glycines actin gene and those of filarial nematodes in (G + C) content and usage of particular codons. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed the presence of 7 introns in the H. glycines actin gene. The first was atypically long and started with a GC dinucleotide, and the fifth intron occupied a novel site in the catalogue of intron positions known thus far for actin genes. Analysis of the partial genomic DNA sequences obtained from 6 other Heterodera spp. suggested that features shown for the H. glycines actin gene are characteristic for a wide range of cyst nematodes.},

Nucleotide homology is high (83% identity), and the respective sequences encode 40 kDa proteins with 89% amino acid identity. Genomic sequences contain six introns located at identical positions in both genes. Intron 4 in the H. glycines gene is > 500 bp. Partial genomic sequences determined for seven other cyst nematode species reveal that the large fourth intron is characteristic of Heterodera but not Globodera aldolase genes. Total aldolase-like specific activity in homogenates from H. glycines was 2-fold lower than in either Caenorhabditis elegans or Panagrellus redivivus (P = 0.001). Activity in H. glycines samples was higher in juvenile stages than in adults (P = 0.003).

	Abstract = {Breeding for resistance to soyabean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) is an important objective of soyabean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeders. There is concern, however, that SCN resistant soyabean cultivars yield less than SCN susceptible cultivars under low SCN pressure. This is supported by the report that two quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring yield depression are linked to the major SCN resistance gene rhg1 on linkage group (LG) G in the resistant plant introduction (PI) 209332. The objective of our study was to test for the association of SCN resistance with yield and other agronomic traits in populations developed from soyabean cultivars with resistance derived from PI 88788. We tested five populations of near isogenic lines (NIL) segregating for genetic markers Satt309 or CTA linked to rhg1 and two populations of NILs segregating for Satt431 linked to the resistance QTL cqSCN-003 on LG J. Population sizes ranged from 23 to 44 NILs, and the populations were yield tested in two years across four locations that had low SCN incidence in previous years. Near isogenic lines predicted to carry the SCN resistance allele yielded significantly (p-1) and in one out of two populations segregating for Satt431 (76 kg ha-1). Significant differences between the two classes of NILs were also observed for plant maturity, plant lodging and plant height in some populations; however, these differences were small in magnitude. Molecular marker data from the NIL populations for the genetic regions flanking the segregating resistance genes suggest the presence of a yield depression QTL distal to rhg1 on LG G and another yield depression QTL linked or pleiotropic to cqSCN-003 on LG J. Confirmation and refinement of our results will enable soyabean breeders to use marker-assisted breeding to select against yield depressing regions and develop SCN resistant cultivars that compete with SCN susceptible cultivars even under low SCN pressure.},

	Abstract = {Supernodulation in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is an important source of nitrogen supply to subterranean ecological systems. Single nucleotide-amplified polymorphism (SNAP) markers for supernodulation should allow rapid screening of the trait in early growth stages, without the need for inoculation and phenotyping. The gene GmNARK (Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase), controlling autoregulation of nodulation, was found to have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between the wild-type cultivar Sinpaldalkong 2 and its supernodulating mutant, SS2-2. Transversion of A to T at the 959-bp position of the GmNARK sequence results in a change of lysine (AAG) to a stop codon (TAG), thus terminating its translation in SS2-2. Based on the identified SNP in GmNARK, five primer pairs specific to each allele were designed using the WebSnaper program to develop a SNAP marker for supernodulation. One A-specific primer pair produced a band present in only Sinpaldalkong 2, while two T-specific pairs showed a band in only SS2-2. Both complementary PCRs, using each allele-specific primer pair were performed to genotype supernodulation against F-2 progeny of Sinpaldalkong 2 x SS2-2. Among 28 individuals with the normal phenotype, eight individuals having only the A-allele-specific band were homozygous and normal, while 20 individuals were found to be heterozygous at the SNP having both A and T bands. Twelve supernodulating individuals showed only the band specific to the T allele. This SNAP marker for supernodulation could easily be analyzed through simple PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Therefore, use of this SNAP marker might be faster, cheaper, and more reproducible than using other genotyping methods, such as a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker, which demand of restriction enzymes.},

	Abstract = {We report the cloning and functional characterization of an endo-beta-1,3-glucanase from the pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. This is the first gene of this type from any nematode species. We show that a similar cDNA is also present in another closely related species B. mucronatus, but that similar sequences are not present in any other nematode studied to date. The B. xylophilus gene is expressed solely in the oesophageal gland cells of the nematode and the protein is present in the nematode's secretions. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene is very similar to glycosyl hydrolase family 16 proteins. The recombinant protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, preferentially hydrolysed the beta-1,3-glucan laminarin, and had very low levels of activity on beta-1,3-1,4-glucan, lichenan and barley beta-glucan. Laminarin was degraded in an endoglucanase mode by the enzyme. The optimal temperature and pH for activity of the recombinant enzyme were 65 degrees C and pH 4.9. The protein is probably important in allowing the nematodes to feed on fungi. Sequence comparisons suggest that the gene encoding the endo-beta-1,3-glucanase was acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. B. xylophilus therefore contains genes that have been acquired by this process from both bacteria and fungi. These findings support the idea that multiple independent horizontal gene transfer events have helped in shaping the evolution of several different life strategies in nematodes.},

	Abstract = {Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) that confer resistance to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Riggs and Niblack) isolate PA3 (HG Type 0, Race 3) were previously mapped in a population of F-2-derived lines developed from a cross with the Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc. plant introduction (PI) 468916. These two QTL represent new resistance genes as they reside in genetic locations that differ from where SCN-resistance QTL in soybean [Glycine max (L). Merr.] cultivars map. The objectives of this research were to confirm the G. soja SCN-resistance QTL in a domestic soybean background and to localize, or better define, the positions of these QTL. Additional molecular markers were identified within the regions containing the SCN-resistance QTL by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and bulked segregant analysis (BSA). Each QTL was localized by developing and testing several backcross populations that segregated for different genomic regions where the resistance QTL map. The SCN-resistance QTL on LG E was localized to a 13.2-cM interval with an average marker distance of 0.6 cM. The SCN-resistance QTL on LG G was localized to an 18.5-cM interval with an average marker distance of 3.1 cM. The AFLP-BSA technique proved to be beneficial for adding molecular markers to the two regions from G. soja that confer resistance to SCN. These closely linked markers will assist in map-based cloning of the G. soja PI 468916 SCN resistance genes which could potentially uncover genes involved in the soybean-SCN interaction and aid with their continued exploration.},

However, little is known about the effects of rotation crops and overwintering on H. glycines biology. These experiments were initiated to determine the effects of seven alternative crops on H. glycines' ability to infect and mature on subsequent soybean crops, and to assess the viability of eggs during the overwintering months. Rotation studies were conducted for 2 years in each of two naturally infested fields, and overwintering tests were conducted in three consecutive growing seasons in one naturally infested field. Rotation crop and fallow treatments did not have a consistent effect on the ability of H. glycines to infect soybean or mature. Soybean yields were often higher following fallow or a nonhost crop than following soybean, although not usually significantly so. Heterodera glycines egg viability did not differ (P < 0.05) between over-wintering months at 0-to-10 or 10-to-20-cm soil depths. These results suggest that H. glycines'ability to infect a subsequent soybean crop and develop to maturity is not diminished by nonhost crops or during the winter months.},

Mi-pel-1 and Mi-pel-2 encoded, respectively, predicted proteins of 271 and 280 amino acids, each of which was preceded by a signal peptide for secretion. Interestingly, these pectate lyases showed diversity at the amino acid level, with only 31% identity and 49% similarity. These pectate lyases were classified into the same family of pectate lyases with those of other phytoparasitic nematodes that contain four conserved regions characteristic of the class III pectate lyases of microbes. In situ mRNA hybridisation analyses showed the transcripts of Mi-pel-1 and Mi-pel-2 accumulated exclusively within the subventral oesophageal gland cells of M. incognita. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that their transcriptions were strong at the pre-parasitic and early parasitic second-stage juveniles, and not detectable at the late parasitic stages of the nematodes. These results indicated that these pectate lyases, like cellulases, could be secreted into plant tissues to facilitate the penetration and intercellular migration of M. incognita during the early stages of plant parasitism.

	Abstract = {Parasitism genes encoding secretory proteins expressed in the oesophageal glands of phytoparasitic nematodes play critical roles in nematode invasion of host plants, establishment of feeding sites and suppression of host defences. Two chorismate mutase (CM) genes potentially having a role in one or more of these processes were identified from a Meloidogyne incognita oesophageal gland-cell subtractive cDNA library. These M. incognita enzymes (designated as MI-CM-1 and MI-CM-2) with amino-terminal signal peptides, were significantly similar to chorismate mutases in M.javanica and bacteria. The complementation of an Escherichia coli CM-deficient mutant by the expression of Mi-cm-1 or Mi-cm-2 confirmed their CM activity. In-situ mRNA hybridization showed that the transcripts of Mi-cm-1 and Mi-cm-2 accumulated specifically in the two subventral oesophageal gland cells of M. incognita. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that their transcript abundances were high in the early parasitic juvenile stages, and low (Mi-cm-1) or undetectable (Mi-cm-2) in later parasitic stages of the nematode. Southern blot analysis revealed that these CM genes were members of a small multigene family in Meloidogyne species. The widespread presence of CMs in the specialized sedentary endoparasitic nematode species suggests that this multifunctional enzyme may be a key factor in modulating plant parasitism.},

	Abstract = {Plant parasitic nematodes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) share plant roots as a resource for food and space. The interest in AMF-nematode interactions ties in the possibility of enhanced resistance or tolerance of AMF-infected plants to nematodes, and the potential value of this for control of crop pests. Data collated from previous studies revealed a great diversity of AMF-nematode responses and we seek to generalise from these by evaluating and discussing interactions involving three groups of nematodes distinguished by their mode of parasitism: (i) ectoparasites; (ii) sedentary endoparasites; and (iii) migratory endoparasites. Based on proximity in tissue, we expected that the interactions between endoparasites and AMF would be stronger, i.e. more reciprocal effects of endoparasitic nematodes on AMF, than those between ectoparasites and AMF Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that, relative to AMF-free plants, AMF-infected plants were damaged more by ectoparasites than by endoparasites. Of the sedentary endoparasites, numbers of root-knot nematodes were reduced more by mycorrhizal. infection than were those of cyst nematodes. The reduction in nematode damage by AMF was not different for root-knot or cyst nematode infested plants. Migratory endoparasitic nematodes were the only group whose numbers were greater on AMF-infected plants. However, the experiments involving migratory nematodes were characterised by relatively high levels of AMF infection and little nematode damage compared to the other feeding types. The outcomes of the AMF-nematode interactions are determined by many factors during the interactions between organisms and their physical, physiological and temporal environments. Assessing effects by recording plant sizes and total nematode or AMF populations at the end of experiments gives very little information on the mechanisms of the interactions. It is time to stop doing studies of black boxes and time to start observing processes, directly by using microscopy and indirectly by application of molecular genetics.

	Abstract = {A survey for nematodes in carrot crops in northern Tasmania detected lesion nematode (Pratylenchus spp.) in 28 of 33 crops, with P. crenatus occurring most frequently and P neglectus, P thornei, and P penetrans occurring infrequently. Root-knot nematode was detected in five of 33 carrot crops, with Meloidogyne fallax present in two crops. The effect of P. crenatus on yield and quality of Kuroda-type carrot was assessed in 42 plots arranged in a 6 x 7 lattice in each of two commercial crops. High numbers of R crenatus were recovered from fine roots at 58 days after sowing (DAS). However, following formation of the taproot, low numbers were recovered. In both crops, there was a significant negative correlation between numbers of P. crenatus per gram dry weight of root at 58 DAS and the dry weight of root and shoot at 58 DAS. However, the low numbers of P. crenatus/g dry weight of root recovered at subsequent sampling times, and the lack of an increase in the number of P. crenatus in the soil during the season, suggested that Kuroda-type carrot became resistant to P. crenatus following taproot formation. In both crops, P crenatus populations were significantly negatively correlated with plant density and in one crop with average carrot weight. Regression analysis predicted potential yield penalties of 12.1 to 22.3 t/ha between plots with the highest number of R crenatus and those with none. There was no significant correlation between P. crenatus populations during the season and carrot defects. Spatial analysis using Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices determined that P. crenatus in soil were significantly aggregated at all times and in roots at 58 DAS were aggregated in one of two trials, with indices of aggregation (I-a) ranging from 1.27 to 1.64.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is a major soybean pest throughout the soybean growing regions in the world, including the USA. Soybean PI 90763 is an important SCN resistance source. It is resistant to several SCN populations including races 2, 3 and 5. But its genetics of resistance is not well known. The objectives of this study were to: (1) confirm quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to SCN race 3 in PI 90763 and (2) identify QTLs for resistance to SCN races 2 and 5. QTLs were searched in Hamilton x PI 90763 F(2:3)populations using 193 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) covering 20 linkage groups (LGs). QTLs for resistance to SCN were identified on LGs A2, B1, E, G, J and L. The same QTL was suggested for resistance to different SCN races where their 1-LOD support intervals of QTL positions highly overlapped. The QTL on LG G was associated with resistance to races 2, 3 and 5. The QTL on LG B1 was associated with resistance to races 2 and 5. The QTL on LG J was associated with resistance to races 2 and 3. The QTLs on LGs A2 and L were associated with resistance to race 3. The QTL on LG E was associated with resistance to race 5. We conclude that LGs A2 and B1 may represent an important distinction between resistance to SCN race 3 and resistance to SCN races 2 and 5 in soybean.},

Approximately 1400 genes were sequenced, 70% from a cDNA library generated from dissected basal bulbs (containing the pharyngeal gland cells) and 30% from cDNA libraries generated from whole mixed stage nematodes. A large portion of the bulb library (48%) was composed of proteins with no matches in the database. Further analysis of these genes revealed that a total of 51 contigs were present, half of which encoded novel secreted proteins. By contrast, the whole nematode library contained more housekeeping and nematode-specific genes. Only one of the novel genes from the whole nematode library had a predicted signal peptide at the N-terminus. Genes encoding transthyretin-like proteins were abundant in the bulb library and in situ hybridisation confirmed that one of these is expressed in the basal bulb. Genes encoding a variety of proteases, which were shown using in situ hybridisation to be expressed in the gut, were also identified.},

	Abstract = {To elucidate the role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signalling in the arrest/reactivation pathway of the Ancylostoma callinum hookworm, two parasite-encoded TGF-beta-like ligands were cloned and characterised. Ac-dbl-1 showed 60% amino acid identity to the Caenorhabditis elegans dbl-1 gene, which regulates growth while Ac-daf-7 showed 46% amino acid identity to Ce-daf-7 which regulates arrested development. Exon/intron organisation of the genes for Ac-dbl-1 and Ac-daf-7 were different from that of the corresponding C elegans genes with nine and 10 exons, respectively, and introns ranging in size from 56 to 2556 bp. Based on real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, Ac-dbl-1 and Ac-daf-7 were expressed in all stages tested, i.e. egg, first/second stage larvae (L1/L2), infective third stage larvae (iL3), serum-stimulated third stage larvae (ssL3), and male and female adult worms. Expression of Ac-dbl-1 peaked in the adult male stage suggesting a similar role to Ce-dbl-1 in regulating male tail patterning. Ac-daf-7 expression was at a maximum in the arrested iL3 and reactivated ssL3 stages, which differs from that of Ce-daf-7 expression and may be unique to parasitic nematodes that have an obligate requirement to undergo developmental arrest. In support of the PCR results, antibodies to the A. caninum TGF-beta-like ligands detected proteins in iL3, ssL3, and adult worm extracts. Immunofluorescent studies showed that Ac-daf-7 is expressed in the anterior region of the iL3 similar to Ce-daf-7, which is localised to the ASI chemosensory neurons.

Using degenerate primers, a 1372 bp cDNA encoding a chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase (Mi-serI) was amplified from total RNA of adult females by RT-PCR and 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The deduced amino acid sequence of Mi-ser1 encoded a putative signal peptide and a prodomain of 22 and 33 amino acids, respectively, and a mature proteinase of 341 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37,680 Da. Sequence identity with the top serine proteinases matches from the databases ranged from 23 to 27%, including sequences from insects, mammals, and other nematodes. Southern blot analysis suggested that Mi-ser1 is encoded by a single or few gene copies. The pattern of developmental expression analyzed by Northern blot and RT-PCR indicated that Mi-ser1 was transcribed mainly in females. The domain architecture composed of a single chymotrypsin-like catalytic domain and the detection of a putative signal peptide suggested a digestive role for Mi-ser1. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Out of this 67 isolates were not parasitic on females of root-knot nematodes whereas 115 isolates, though colonized the egg masses, did not show any signs of parasitism on nematode eggs. Fifty-nine isolates showed 50-90% inhibition in egg hatch.

These groups Cortespond to previously identified virulence ggenes in the nematode. as follows: the dominant gene in H. glycines to P188788, and the recessive,genes to P190763 and Pickett/Peking. Virulence allele frequencies and virulence genotype frequencies of selected field isolates were investigated by testing the host range of single-fernale-derived lines, which were developed through single-female inoculation on the standard susceptible soybean 'Lee 68'. By comparing Virulence genotype frequencies between the original field isolates and their single-fernale-derived lines. we were able to determine allele frequencies in the field populations. The results suggest that tremendous variation in H. glycines virulence genes exists among field populations. Potential mechanisms of selection which could Cause virulence genotype frequency increases are discussed as related to population genetics equilibrium theory.},

Resistant genotypes E97-2502-9-3-1 and E97-2502-9-3-5 (types PI 437654) were crossed to the susceptible parent E96-776 (type 'Hartwig') to obtain 20 F) (plants, 120 F)(2) (plants and 120 F)(2:3) families. The greenhouse trials involved those generations plus 20 plants of each parental genotype. Seedlings of each generation and of the race-differential cultivars were transplanted to clay pots and inoculated with 4000 eggs. After 28 days, the root system of each plant was washed and the females collected and counted. The inoculations resulted in high numbers of females in the susceptible genotypes in both crosses, confirming the presence of race 4+. The genetic analysis revealed no reciprocal cross effects, but some transgressive segregation with partial dominance toward resistance, and heritability estimates of medium to high magnitude. Resistant control in cross E96-776 x E97-2502-9-3-1 involved expression of additive, dominant and additive x additive epistatic effects, which suggests the presence of at least two genes. A single-gene hypothesis sufficed to explain the observed segregation in the E96-776 x E97-2502-9-3-5 cross with a simple additive-dominant model showing good fit to the data.

In a separate experiment, the same PIs were infected by an inbred line that tested as an HG Type 0 (i.e., the numbers of females that developed on each PI were less than 10% of the number that developed on the standard susceptible soybean Culfivar Lee). In this experiment, male numbers were similar to female numbers on PI 548402, 90763, 437654, and 89772, whereas male numbers on PI 88788, 209332, and 548316 were higher than those of females (a = 0.05). In all experiments, the total number of adults that developed to maturity relative to the number of second-stage juveniles that initially penetrated the root was less on resistant than on susceptible soybean (P ! 0.05), indicating that resistance influenced H. glycines survival and not sexual development.},

	Abstract = {The biological control effectiveness of Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Hirsutella minnesotensis, two endoparasitic nematophagous fungi, was evaluated using solid cultures of corn grits against the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, in greenhouse experiments. Both fungi, either applied at planting or 2 weeks before planting, were highly effective in control of the nematode. The biological control effectiveness increased with increasing inoculation level of the solid culture from 0.04 to 1% (corn grits:soil, w/w). Control differed between the two species and among isolates. H. rhossiliensis was more effective than H. minnesotensis, and H. rhossiliensis isolate OWVT-1 appeared to be the most effective among all isolates tested. In some experiments, the isolate OWVT-1 almost completely controlled the nematode population. Soil heating treatment increased the effectiveness of the fungi as compared with no-heating treatment. The percentage of H. glycines second-stage juveniles (J2) parasitized by the fungi at the end of the experiment (60 days after planting) was not correlated with level of biological control of the nematode. Parasitism of J2 by H. rhossiliensis at the end of experiment was negatively correlated with fungal inoculation level and positively correlated with the final nematode population densities. H. minnesotensis appeared to establish slower in soil than H. rhossiliensis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) continues to be the most damaging soybean pest [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in the USA. A major gene that provides partial resistance to SCN is rhg1, which is located on linkage group (LG) G. The objectives of this study were to test the effect of rhg1 on SCN reproduction in both the field and greenhouse and on agronomic traits in the field. Two populations of near isogenic lines (NILs) that segregated for rhg1 were developed to test the effect of the gene. These NIL populations were tested for their ability to support SCN cyst development in a thermo-regulated water bath in a greenhouse and egg production estimated from soil samples taken from each plot in field tests. The NIL populations were evaluated for agronomic traits in field plots to determine the associated effects of rhg1 on these traits. In the greenhouse, NILs predicted to be carrying the resistance allele for rhg1 on the basis of a linked marker supported significantly (P 500 SCN eggs (100 cm(3)soil)(-1)]. These results show that resistance at rhg1 can have a large effect on SCN reproduction and may result in a significant yield increase.},

	Abstract = {A homologue of a Ran binding protein to microtubules (ranbpm) gene, initially known as IC5, was identified and characterised in second-stage juveniles (J2s) of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida. The full-length cDNA (937 bp) was obtained by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and specific primers were designed to amplify the genomic sequences of 2396 bp containing six introns. The ORF (798 bp) encodes a putative 265 amino acid sequence with a predicted SPRY domain and a signal peptide of 23 amino acids on the N-terminal part of the protein. In situ hybridisation experiments showed that the transcript is located in the dorsal gland of the J2s, suggesting that the encoded protein has an extracellular function and can be involved in the late stages of parasitism such as feeding site establishment. This gene was specifically over-expressed in the juveniles before and during parasitism, but not in adult developmental stages. As this gene is presumed to be involved in plant-nematode interaction, particularly in the development and maintenance of the feeding structure that allows the nematode to achieve parasitic development, homologous genes were sought in other cyst nematode species. One of them was cloned and sequenced in the closely related species Globodera 'mexicana'. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Plant-parasitic nematodes or round worms are major pests in agriculture. Worldwide, nematodes cause more than $100 billion in losses annually. These small worm-like organisms, each equipped with a hollow stylet, are transparent and measure from 300 to 1500 mu m in length and 15 to 35 mu m in diameter. Their small diameter does not allow us to see them with the naked eye but they are easily observed under a stereomicroscope. In Canada, there are 19 genera and 37 species of plant-parasitic nematodes associated with a plant disease. The majority, 16 genera and 31 species, parasitize the root system. They can cause a wide range of plant damage, from somewhat negligible to total crop loss. The severity of damage caused to the plants is related to various factors including the plant-nematode combination, environmental factors such water precipitation, soil type, and also cultural practices. When feeding, they puncture the root with their hollow stylet and thus reduce the capacity of water and nutritious elements uptake by the root system. The typical symptoms of nematode feeding are the reduction in root system, a distortion of the root structure and an increase in root diameter. Among the most prevalent pests, we must include the following endoparasitic species: the northern root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla, the root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans, the stem and bulb nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci, the dagger nematode Xiphinema rivesi, and the soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines. Even though they are found in Canada, nematodes such as the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida are quarantine organisms and must be intercepted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to prevent them from spreading over the territory. In Canada, the management of plant-parasitic nematodes is ensured by cultural methods (e.g., crop rotation, resistance) and chemicals.},

	Abstract = {A genetic linkage map of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines was constructed using a population of F-2 individuals obtained from matings between two highly inbred SCN lines, TN16 and TN20. The AFLP fingerprinting technique was used to genotype 63 F-2 progeny with two restriction enzyme combinations (EcoRI/MseI and PstI/TaqI) and 38 primer combinations. The same F-2 population was also genotyped for Hg-cm-1 (H. glycines chorismate mutase-1), a putative virulence gene, using real-time quantitative PCR. Some of the markers were found to be distributed non-randomly. Even so, of the 230 markers analyzed, 131 could be mapped onto ten linkage groups at a minimum LOD of 3.0, for a total map distance of 539 cM. The Hg-cm-1 locus mapped to linkage group III together with 16 other markers. The size of the H. glycines genome was estimated to be in the range of 630-743 cM, indicating that the current map represents 73-86% of the genome, with a marker density of one per 4.5 cM, and a physical/genetic distance ratio of between 124 kb/cM and 147 kb/cM. This genetic map will be of great assistance in mapping H. glycines markers to genes of interest, such as nematode virulence genes and genes that control aspects of nematode parasitism.},

Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms whereby plants are protected from nematode invasion (hypersensitivity reactions, apoptosis, phytoalexins, proteinase inhibitors, PR proteins, etc.). Consideration is given to genetic aspects of plant-parasite relationships.

	Abstract = {In plants and laboratory animals, QTL mapping is commonly performed using F(2) or BC individuals derived from the cross of two inbred lines. Typical QTL mapping statistics assume that each F(2) individual is genotyped for the markers and phenotyped for the trait. For plant traits with low heritability, it has been suggested to use the average phenotypic values of F(3) progeny derived from selfing F(2) plants in place of the F(2) phenotype itself. All F(3) progeny derived from the same F(2) plant belong to the same F(2:3) family, denoted by F(2:3). If the size of each F(2:3) family (the number of F(3) progeny) is sufficiently large, the average value of the family will represent the genotypic value of the F(2) plant, and thus the power of QTL mapping may be significantly increased. The strategy of using F(2) marker genotypes and F(3) average phenotypes for QTL mapping in plants is quite similar to the daughter design of QTL mapping in dairy cattle. We study the fundamental principle of the plant version of the daughter design and develop a new statistical method to map QTL under this F(2:3) strategy. We also propose to combine both the F(2) phenotypes and the F(2:3) average phenotypes to further increase the power of QTL mapping. The statistical method developed in this study differs from published ones in that the new method fully takes advantage of the mixture distribution for F(2:3) families of heterozygous F(2) plants. Incorporation of this new information has significantly increased the statistical power of QTL detection relative to the classical F(2) design, even if only a single F(3) progeny is collected from each F(2:3) family. The mixture model is developed on the basis of a single-QTL model and implemented via the EM algorithm. Substantial computer simulation was conducted to demonstrate the improved efficiency of the mixture model. Extension of the mixture model to multiple QTL analysis is developed using a Bayesian approach. The computer program performing the Bayesian analysis of the simulated data is available to users for real data analysis.},

This study sought to identify NVS-mediated changes in soil chemical properties and their impact upon H. glycines and Meloidogyne incognita mortality. N-Viro Soil was applied to sand in laboratory assays at 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0% dry w/w with a nonamended treatment as a control. Nematode mortality and changes in sand-assay chemical properties were determined 24 hours after incubation. Calculated lethal concentration (LC90) values were 1.4% w/w NVS for second-stage juveniles of both nematode species and 2.6 and >3.0% kv/w NVS for eggs of M. incognita and H. glycines, respectively. Increasing rates of NVS were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.84) with higher sand solution pH levels. Sand solution pH levels and, to a lesser extent, the production of ammonia appeared to be the inorganic chemical-mediated factors responsible for killing plant-parasitic nematodes following amendment with NVS.},

	Abstract = {In the study of the biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes, knowledge of the saprophytic ability of a nematophagous fungus is necessary to understand its establishment and survival in the soil. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine if the nematophagous fungus ARF (Arkansas Fungus) shows differential use of plant residues; and (ii) to determine if ARF still existed in the soil of a field in which ARF was found originally and in which the population level of Heterodera glycines had remained very low, despite 15 years of continuous, susceptible soybean. Laboratory studies of the decomposition of wheat straw or soybean root by ARF were conducted in two separate experiments, using a CO2 collection apparatus, where CO2-free air was passed through sterilized cotton to remove the microorganisms in the air and then was passed over the samples, and evolved CO2 was trapped by KOH. Milligrams of C as CO2 was used to calculate the percentage decomposition of the plant debris by ARF. Data indicated ARF decomposed 11.7% of total organic carbon of the wheat straw and 20.1% of the soybean roots in 6 weeks. In the field soil study, 21 soil samples were taken randomly from the field. Only 3 months after the infestation of the soil with H. glycines, the percentage of parasitized eggs of H. glycines reached 64 +/- 19%, and ARF was isolated from most parasitized eggs of H. glycines. Research results indicated ARF could use plant residues to survive.},

Soil samples were collected from cotton fields located in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Eight genera of fungi were included in the 128 fungal isolates obtained, and among them were five strains of the nematophagous fungus ARE The mtDNA RFLP pattern, colony growth characteristics, and pathogenicity indicate the five ART isolates represent one described strain and one new strain. Light and electron microscopic observations suggest ARF is an active parasite of R. with parasitism ranging from 48% to 79% in in vitro tests. Three greenhouse experiments demonstrated ARF successfully suppressed the number of reniform nematodes during the first and second generation of the nermatode. Reductions in numbers of R. reniformis on the roots for the seven application rates of 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% ARF were 87%, 92%, 94%, 96%, 97%. 98%, and and 98%, respectively.},

	Abstract = {The sterile nematophagous fungus ARF (Arkansas fungus) had been separated into two phenotypes based on morphological differences: those with compact sclerotium-like-structures (SLS) (ARF-C), and those with loose SLS (ARF-L). The ARF-L isolate TN14 had been more effective than the ARF-C isolate BG2 in suppressing nematode numbers in glasshouse studies, and the BG2 isolate had been more virulent in in vitro tests. No tests had been conducted on the effect of depth in the soil on the level of parasitism by ARE The objectives of this study were to determine: i) which isolate is more competitive in field microplots by comparing isolation frequency of the two fungal strains from parasitised eggs of Heterodera glycines; and ii) whether parasitism by ARF varies with soil depth (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 cm deep). TN14 was isolated more frequently than BG2, irrespective of whether the original mixture of BG2 and TN14 was 50% TN14 + 50% BG2,75% TN14 + 25% BG2, or 25% TN14 + 75% BG2. The percentage of parasitised eggs of H. glycines by ARF was different for the 0-10 cm soil layer vs the 10-20 cm soil layer, or the 0-10 cm soil layer vs the 20-30 cm soil layer. Parasitism by ARF was greatest at a soil depth of 10-20 cm. This would correspond with the level where the root concentration and numbers of cysts should be greatest.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between sedentary endoparasitic nematodes and plants is fascinating, because these animals have developed an ingenious way to manipulate the plant's gene regulation and metabolism to their own advantage. They are able to form highly specialized feeding structures in the plant root to satisfy their nutritional demands for development and reproduction. This ability makes them extremely successful parasites with severe consequences for agriculture. Triggered by these economical losses, detailed studies of the parasitic interaction have been performed, which resulted in an extensive descriptive knowledge. However, the underlying biochemical and molecular events of this intimate relationship have still not been elucidated. It is generally accepted that secretions produced by the nematode are responsible for the dramatic alteration of specific cells in the host plant. In the past few years, the identification of genes coding for secreted proteins was a breakthrough in plant nematode research. However, the available information is still too limited to allow the formulation of a comprehensive model, mainly because the sequences of many of these genes are novel with no similar sequence found in the existing databases. A new challenge in the coming years will be the functional analysis of these putative parasitism genes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Soyabean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) resistance in soyabean is a complex oligogenic trait. One of the most important nematode resistance genes, rhg1, has been mapped to a distal region of molecular linkage group G in soyabean. A simplified genetic system to identify soyabean genes with modified expression in response to SCN led to the identification of several genes within the nematode feeding sites. The genes were mapped to reveal their linkage relationship to known QTLs associated with soyabean cyst nematode (SCN) resistance. One candidate, a phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine (FGAM) synthase (EC 6.3.5.3) gene, mapped to the same genomic interval as the major SCN resistance gene rhg1 within linkage group G. Isolation of FGAM synthase from a soyabean bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library revealed two highly homologous paralogues. The genes appeared to be well conserved between bacteria and humans. Promoter analysis of the two soyabean homologues was carried out with the Arabidopsis thaliana-Heterodera schachtii system to investigate gene response to nematode feeding. The two promoters and their derived deletion constructions effected green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression within nematode feeding sites. The 1.0-kb promoter sequence immediately adjacent to the translation start site was sufficient to direct expression of GFP within syncytia. A wound-inducible element and a floral organ expression sequence were also identified within these promoters. Although a nematode-responsive element could not be identified, the observed expression of GFP within feeding sites supports the hypothesis that plant gene expression is redirected within feeding sites to benefit the parasite.},

	Abstract = {The induction of defense compounds in oats (Avena sativa) in response to invasion by parasitic nematodes and to application of the wound hormone methyl jasmonate was examined. Oats cv. Quoit seedlings were challenged with Pratylenchus neglectus, Heterodera avenae, and Ditylenchus dipsaci and treated with 1 x 10(-4) M methyl jasmonate. Three compounds, isolated in methanolic root and shoot extracts of oats, exhibiting an absorbance spectrum typical of flavone glycosides, were induced by nematode invasion and methyl jasmonate. These were identified as flavone-C-glycosides by mass spectrometry. The effect of the flavone-C-glycosides on the invasion by and development of cereal cyst nematode H. avenae was assessed using methanolic extracts of shoots and roots from methyl jasmonate-treated plants. Both extracts impaired nematode invasion and development. When the extracts were fractionated by high voltage paper electrophoresis, only one flavone-C-glycoside. O-methylapigenin-C-deoxyhexoside-O-hexoside, inhibited nematode invasion. The protective effect of the induction of flavone-C-glycosides in oats by methyl jasmonate was evaluated against H. avenae and P. neglectus. Treatment with methyl jasmonate reduced invasion of both nematodes and increased plant mass, compensating for damage caused by the nematodes, and is attributed to the active flavone-C-glycoside. The active compound, O-methyl-apigenin-C-deoxyhexoside-O-hexoside, has not been implicated previously in plant defense against any pest or pathogen, and appears to provide protection against the major cereal nematodes Heterodera and Pratylenchus.},

	Abstract = {While multiple genes are optimal for corroborating nematode phylogenies, only a few are commonly used. Here we examine the phylogenetic potential of the nuclear Hsp90 chaperone gene. We used degenerate primers to obtain partial Hsp90 sequences from several plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes. Hsp90 was single-copy in Heterodera glycines and Meloidogyne javanica, similar to the situation for Caenorhabditis elegans. The full-length H. glycines Hsp90 protein sequence showed homology to sequences from C. elegans and Brugia pahangi and to other eukaryotes, and contains several functionally important regions common to cytoplasmic Hsp90 proteins. The Hsp90 amino acid phylogeny supported the Coelomata hypothesis for metazoan evolution. Phylogenetic trees, substitution scatter plots, and statistics for phylogenetic signal were made for Hsp90. 18S small subunit (SSU), and 28S large subunit (LSU) over a limited but broad sampling of nematode taxa. Only the LSU data set failed to recover any of the expected topology and showed extensive substitution saturation. In an intensive sampling of plant-parasitic nematode taxa, the Hsp90 tree topologies were generally congruent with rDNA results and alignments were unambiguous. Hsp90 sequences may help strengthen branch support or clarify tree topologies when other molecules show ambiguous alignments, greater branch-length heterogeneity, or codon bias in certain taxonomic groups.},

	Abstract = {Cysteine proteinases (CPs) are synthesized as zymogens and converted to mature proteinase forms by proteolytic cleavage and release of their pro domain peptides. A cDNA encoding a papain-like CP, called hgcp-Iv, was isolated from a Heterodera glycines J2 cDNA library, expressed and utilized to assess the ability of its propeptide to inhibit proteinase in its active form. The hgcp-Iv cDNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 374 amino acids with the same domain organization as other cathepsin L-like CPs, including a hydrophobic signal sequence and a pro domain region. HGCP-Iv, produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with thioredoxin, degrades the synthetic peptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin and is inhibited by E-64, a substrate and inhibitor commonly used for functional characterization of CPs. Recombinant propeptides of HGCP-Iv, expressed in E. coli, presented high inhibitory activity in vitro towards its cognate enzyme and proteinase activity of Meloidogyne incognita females, suggesting its usefulness in inhibiting nematode CPs in biological systems. Cysteine proteinases from other species produced no noticeable activity.},

	Abstract = {The sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii is a soil-dwelling phytoparasitic nematode that feeds on beet roots. It is an important pest in most sugar beet growing areas, and better knowledge of its genetic variability is an important step to preserve the durability of resistant sugar beet varieties. The population genetic structure of this species in northern France was studied using five microsatellite markers. A hierarchical sampling design was used to investigate spatial structuring at the scale of the region, the field and the plant. Multilocus genotypes were obtained for single individual second-stage larvae, using only one individual per cyst in order to avoid the analysis of closely allied individuals (larvae from the same cyst share at least the same mother). A consistent trend of heterozygote deficit at all loci was observed at all spatial scales. Heterozygote deficit at the level of individual plants argues against its generation through a Wahlund effect. Inbreeding could be due to very limited active dispersal of larvae in the soil, favouring mating between siblings, such as larvae emerging from the same cyst. Such behaviour could have important consequences for the evolution of virulence in increasing the production of homozygous virulent individuals. Moreover, an analysis of molecular variance (amova) reveals that only 1.6% of the genetic variability is observed among regions, 3.7% among fields of the same region and 94.6% within fields. The very low level of genetic differentiation among fields is also indicated by low values of F-ST (less than or equal to 0.105) even for fields 150 km apart. We suggest that long-distance gene flows occur due to passive transport of cysts by human activities, water or wind. As such mechanisms of gene flow would involve cysts and not larvae, the strong signals of inbreeding observed at the local scale should not be disrupted. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first investigation of the genetic structure of a phytoparasitic nematode based on neutral codominant genetic markers scored in single individuals.},

Stresses include water, soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines), herbicide injury, Rhizoctonia root rot disease (Rhizoctonia solani), and hail damage. The user can set up a field scenario by selecting cultivar, planting date, plant population, soil type, and the nearest weather station using a web form. Different stress levels can then be entered, and the model can be run interactively by simulating the effects of one or more stresses at a time. A summary table of model simulations is generated and presented onscreen allowing users to examine individual and combined effects of plant stresses. The results are stored on the server, thus allowing the users to view these results in another session. WebGro also offers interactive graphical output that lets users view daily changes in soybean biomass weight for a specific field or scenario. WebGro is available at http:// webgro.ae.iastate.edu.},

	Abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] germplasm PI 437654 exhibits broad resistance to soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, SCN). Probes derived from PI 437654 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone 15G19 at the Rhg4 locus detected a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) between resistant and susceptible germplasms. Detailed RFLP analysis using restriction fragments from BAC clone 15G19 associated the polymorphism with an 8-kb BamHI fragment containing the promoter region and partial coding sequence of a novel soybean subtilisin-like protease, GmSUB1. Complete sequence of GmSUB1 was determined (GenBank AY277949). Regulatory elements for root gene expression, pathogen response, coordinated multiple-gene expression, and a novel 90-bp direct repeat were identified. GmSUB1 shows 74% similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana AIR3. Hybridization analyses indicate that PI 437654 contains only full-length copies of GmSUB1, whereas susceptible germplasm 'Williams 82' contains both full-length and truncated copies of the gene. A 4-fold increase in GmSUB1 copy number, and a corresponding 2- to 3-fold increase in steady state GmSUB1 mRNA levels, was observed in PI 437654 compared with Williams 82. Localization and polymorphism of GmSUB1 within the Rhg4 resistance region, and increases in GmSUB1 gene copy number and expression in PI 437654 compared with Williams 82 infers a functional role in the pathogen response. GmSUB1 is believed to be secreted into the extracellular matrix, and may function in reorganization of cell wall components during plant development and in the defense response.},

Fungal isolates were grown for 3 and 7 days in potato dextrose broth (PDB), the culture broths were sterile-filtered to remove fungal biomass, and the filtrates were placed into 24-well plates to test for effects on egg hatch and juvenile motility. Meloidogyne incognita egg hatch ranged from 2 to 121% of hatch in PDB controls and H. glycines hatch from 15 to 224%. Activities of filtrates harvested after 3 and 7 days were significantly correlated. Only four isolates produced filtrates that significantly inhibited juvenile motility of SCN, RKN or both nematodes. This study identified fungal isolates capable of producing compounds active against these nematodes, and demonstrated that there was a low correlation in activity against SCN and RKN.

Although nematodes of both species infected both genotypes at all of the soil pH, the numbers decreased with decreasing soil pH. Both genotypes seem to be better hosts for M. incognita than for H. glycines, Davis more so than PI 416937. Both nematodes decreased shoot weight at high inoculum levels, indicating that H. glycines may be more pathogenic than M. incognita. Nematode development after infection of roots was not affected by soil pH or by genotypes. Overall, the results suggest that adaptation of these nematodes should be considered in breeding programmes to develop low pH tolerant soybean cultivars.},

	Abstract = {We previously isolated a partial soybean cDNA clone (D17.1) whose corresponding transcript increases in susceptible roots 1 day post inoculation (dpi) with the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Here we isolated the corresponding full-length cDNA from a soybean cDNA library and designated this gene of unknown function Gt17.1. rime course RNA gel blot analyses revealed that Gt17.1 mRNA steady-state levels were elevated in soybean roots following H. glycines infection up to at least 6 dpi. For further in-depth study we identified a homologous Arabidopsis thaliana gene and designated this gene At17.1. Arabidopsis is successfully infected by the sugar beet cyst nematode (H. schachtii), a close relative of H. glycines. We isolated the At17.1 promoter, fused it to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed this construct into Arabidopsis plants as well as soybean hairy roots. Histochemical analysis of plant materials containing the At17.1::GUS construct revealed that the At17.1 promoter is functional in Arabidopsis as well as in soybean and that during normal plant development the At17.1 promoter directs GUS expression predominantly to the vascular tissues and root tips of both plant species. When At17.1::GUS Arabidopsis plants and soybean hairy roots were inoculated with cyst nematodes, strong GUS activity was detected within the cyst nematode-induced feeding structures. Further tests of At17. 1 promoter activity in Arabidopsis revealed that this promoter was induced by auxin, jasmonic acid, mannitol and dehydration. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays of At17.1 expression confirmed the observed promoter characteristics. Based on our expression data and the observation that both the soybean and the Arabidopsis homologues behaved in a similar fashion following cyst nematode infection, it is likely that these genes are closely associated with cyst nematode parasitism of plants, potentially with hormone and osmotic changes occurring in the developing nematode feeding cells. Furthermore, these data provide additional insights into the strengths of the Arabidopsis-H. schachtii pathosystem to study cyst nematode-plant interactions in lieu of less tractable pathosystems. This finding is supported by the fact that the Arabidopsis promoter tested here produced similar results in Arabidopsis and soybean.},

The pathogenic characteristics of P sojae populations in several Midwestern states have been reported recently, but pathogenicity and fungicide sensitivity traits of populations in Illinois were poorly understood. Isolates (n = 121) of soybean-infecting Phytophthora spp. were baited using susceptible cv. Sloan seedlings from soybean field soils with a history of seedling diseases in 24 counties across Illinois. The pathotype and race of isolates of R sojae were characterized using 11 differential soybean cultivars in greenhouse tests using a hypocotyl inoculation method. Sensitivity to the fungicidal compounds metalaxyl and mefenoxam was tested with 63 isolates in vitro. Most (96%) of the Phytophthora isolates sampled from Illinois soybean fields were P. sojae, but 4% were an unidentified Phytophthora sp. as determined by phenotypic and genotypic traits. We present a preliminary description of another Phytophthora sp. from soybean fields in a restricted region of Illinois that is pathogenic and capable of killing soybean. Based on eight Rps gene differentials (Rps1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1k, 3a, 6, and 7), 22 virulence pathotypes of R sojae were identified and 88% of all isolates were characterized to a defined race. The four most common races, which were 58% of all isolates, were races 1 (21%), 4 (15%), 33 (12%), and 28 (10%). Based on 11 differentials, (those noted above and Rps 2, 4, and 5), 31 virulence pathotypes were identified. The mean virulence complexities, which are the number of susceptible interactions on the sets of 8 and 11 Rps gene differentials, were 3.3 and 3.7, respectively. All isolates tested were sensitive to Apron XL, Allegiance, technical grade mefenoxam, and technical grade metalaxyl at 1.0 mug a.i./ml. The population of P. sojae is diverse and composed of multiple pathotypes and races in Illinois, and the results suggest that pathogen virulence partially explains poor performance of Phytophthora-resistant cultivars in many Illinois soybean fields.},

At an inoculum level of 2500 J2 per plant, similar numbers of J2 were detected in both NIL sampled daily up to 4 days after inoculation (DAI), although juvenile numbers in roots varied among experiments and over the sampling points. Samples were collected at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 21 DAI to observe nematode development. All life stages of the nematode were detected in both NIL. No significant differences were observed between the NIL in the number of nematodes at juvenile stages or the adult male stage in the roots. By contrast, significant differences were detected in the number of mature females. Adult females were first seen at 12 DAI. A significantly lower number of females was consistently detected on the NIL-R line than on the NIL-S line at both 16 and 21 DAI. The number of females per plant on the NIL-R line was about 31 and 23% of those on the NIL-S line at 16 and 21 DAI, respectively. On average, the number of females at 21 DAI represented 7% of the number of J2 at I DAI on the NIL-R line. compared to 28% on the NIL-S line. Significantly fewer eggs were produced per female from the NIL-R line than from the NIL-S line at 21 DAI. At 28 DAI the females on the NIL-R line were also significantly smaller than those from the NIL-S line. This study demonstrated that the presence of the rhg1 gene did not stop the nematode from penetrating. Instead, the effect of the rhgl gene was to slowly suppress SCN growth, development and fecundity of females.},

	Abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are attractive DNA markers due to their abundance and potential for use in automated high-throughput genotyping. Numerous SNP genotyping assays have been developed, but it is unclear which assays are best suited and most efficient for various types of plant improvement research. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy, efficiency, and cost of four SNP genotyping assays: single-base extension (SBE), allele-specific primer extension (ASPE), oligonucleotide ligation (OL), and direct hybridization (DH). All four assay methods used the same Luminex 100 flow cytometer platform. Fifty-eight F-2-derived soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] lines from a cross between inbred lines G99-G725 and N00-3350 were genotyped at four SNPs. SBE and ASPE clearly differentiated between the two homozygotes and the heterozygote at each SNP. Results were in agreement with those identified using the SNaPshot minisequencing assay as a control. In contrast, the OL and DH assays were unable to differentiate between genotypes at some of the SNPs. However, when the cost per data point for the four different assays was compared, the cost of OL and DH was only about 70% of that for SBE, with DH requiring the least time of the four assays. On the basis of cost and labor, ASPE is more cost-effective and simpler than SBE, and would therefore be a good method for genetic mapping and diversity studies which require a large number of markers and a high level of multiplexing. DH appears to be the most economical assay for marker-assisted selection, though optimization for DH would be required for some SNP markers.},

DNA was extracted from single females of race I and race 3 populations. Five primers were selected and 50 consistent fragments were considered for further analysis. Populations studied showed high levels of genetic diversity. Most of the total variation detected in allele frequencies was attributed to variability among individuals of the same population (83%) rather than inter-population differences (17%). None of the populations demonstrated exclusive bands. However, 68% of fragments showed significant differences in their allele frequencies. This study revealed an important degree of genetic differentiation between both populations, probably as a consequence of limited gene flow between them or because each population was under different management practices at its site of origin. Results herein represent the first analysis of genetic structure in H. glycines populations using RAPD-PCR technique.},

	Abstract = {Root-knot [Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) Chitwood] and lesion [Pratylenchuspenetrans (Cobb) Chitwood & Oteifa] nematodes are important pathogens that cause yield and quality losses for most vegetable and field crops in Maryland when they exceed certain threshold levels and if control measures are not applied. Chemical nematicides are the primary control tactic, but their use is both costly and raises environmental concerns. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of crop rotation and other cultural practices for management of southern root-knot nematodes (RKNs) and lesion nematodes. Three nonhost crops, a RKN-resistant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivar, and poultry litter/tillage (Year 1) and fallow (Year 2) were used as summer rotation crops/management options following production of nematode-susceptible crops on two sites in Dorchester County, MD, on Downer and Hammonton sandy loam soils (coarse-loamy, siliceous, mesic Typic and Aquic Hapludults), respectively. Sorghum sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) X S. arundinaceum (Desv.) Stapf var. sudanense (Stapf) Hitchc.], grown annually as a green manure crop following a nematode-susceptible crop [potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) or cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)], reduced the RKN population as effectively as the control treatment (soybean cultivar with no known RKN resistance and one nematicide application). Sorghum sudangrass and poultry litter/tillage/fallow were equally effective in managing the lesion nematode population. Annual inclusion of these practices was necessary to maintain the reduced population levels that were attained for these two nematode species. Finally, either summer or early-fall sampling dates were determined to be more effective than a midspring sampling date for identifying threshold levels of these two pests.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is the most important pathogen of soybean, Glycine max, in North Carolina. Cultural practices are the most effective means of managing this pathogen because a majority of cultivars are susceptible to the races of this nematode that predominate in the state. Resistant and susceptible cultivars were evaluated in 14 H. glycines-infested fields from 1992 to 1999. Resistance in cvs. Hartwig and Delsoy 5710, an line S92-1603 derived from plant introduction (PI) 437654, was highly effective against all populations of H. glycines evaluated in these experiments. Numbers of cysts (cysts and white females) per three plants 28 days after planting and final egg population densities (Pf) were lower than on other cultivars evaluated. Cultivars with SCN resistance derived from PI 90763 were moderately resistant in many of the test fields, but cultivars with Peking-derived resistance were effective at only two locations. Some cultivars with resistance derived from PI 88788 were highly to moderately resistant to races 9 or 14 of SCN, but were not consistently effective against other populations. Hartwig and Delsoy 57 10 had low SCN reproductive factors (Rf = egg density at harvest/mean egg density at planting for site) of 0.16 and 0.23 compared with an Rf of 1.9 and 2.19 on the susceptible cvs. Essex and Hutcheson, respectively. In contrast, the Rf on cultivars derived from Peking generally was greater than on susceptible cultivars. Resistant cvs. Hartwig and Delsoy 5710 generally yielded more than susceptible cultivars or cultivars derived from other sources of resistance. The initial inoculum level (Pi) was negatively correlated with soybean seed yield, but cysts 28 days after planting proved to be better at predicting seed yield than Pi. Due to the genetic diversity of H. glycines populations with regard to the ability to parasitize resistant cultivars, cultivars with resistance derived from PI 437654 or other genotypes are needed to manage this nematode in North Carolina.},

	Abstract = {We report the cloning and characterisation of full-length DNAs complementary to RNA (cDNAs) encoding two glutathione peroxidases (GpXs) from a plant parasitic nematode, the potato cyst nematode (PCN) Globodera rostochiensis. One protein has a functional signal peptide that targets the protein for secretion from animal cells while the other is predicted to be intracellular. Both genes are expressed in all parasite stages tested. The mRNA encoding the intracellular GpX is present throughout the nematode second stage juvenile and is particularly abundant in metabolically active tissues including the genital primordia. The mRNA encoding the secreted GpX is restricted to the hypodermis, the outermost cellular layer of the nematode, a location from which it is likely to be secreted to the parasite surface. Biochemical studies confirmed the secreted protein as a functional GpX and showed that, like secreted GpXs of other parasitic nematodes, it does not metabolise hydrogen peroxide but has a preference for larger hydroperoxide substrates. The intracellular protein is likely to have a role in metabolism of active oxygen species derived from internal body metabolism while the secreted protein may protect the parasite from host defences. Other functional roles for this protein are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The modified AS-PCR that introduces an additional base mismatch closest to the 3'-end of the AS primers and uses publicly available microsatellite markers as positive controls directly determined SNP alleles from primary PCR of genomic DNAs. It was demonstrated that a set of AS primers designed from two adjacent SNP loci could simultaneously detect the two SNP loci. Using the modified procedure, many SNP loci in eight soybean parental lines and F-2 individuals of three mapping populations could be genotyped.

The objective of this study was to survey single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and to map the SCN-resistant gene, Rhg4, on soyabean genetic map. Direct sequencing with 2 primer sets revealed that 3 SNPs and 7 indels were detected among 6 different soyabean genotypes. The designed oligonucleotide complementary to the 5' region from the T(A)/C(G) SNP out of 10 SNPs detected was used in SNaPshot reactions, confirming polymorphism between PI 96188 and Jinju 1. Using a total of 90 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between PI 96188 x Jinju 1, the genetic population was mapped with 32 SSR markers, in which 13 markers were placed into 5 linkage groups, covering 78.6 cM, with an average distance of 6.1 cM between markers. Even though the genetic map was not completely saturated with SSR markers, linkage study revealed that Rhg4 was tightly linked to Satt187 on LG A2 with a distance of 6.8 cM. The location of Rhg4 on the genetic map is a good agreement with the previous report in the USDA map. From this study, it was concluded that sequence data availability of the responsible gene for the SCN resistance and sequence polymorphism between two parents map the gene successfully without phenotypic evaluation. In addition, SNP marker for SCN resistance map may be used in a marker-assisted selection for development of SCN-resistant soyabean cultivars in a breeding programme.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and Phialophora gregata f. sp. sojae, the causal agent of brown stem rot (BSR), are two pathogens of soybean commonly found in the same field throughout the north-central United States. Field experiments designed to study the role of SCN-resistant germ plasm in soybean production have led to data suggesting that some sources of SCN resistance also may provide resistance to BSR. Soybean germ plasm with resistance to SCN was evaluated in greenhouse and field environments for resistance to BSR development based on the percentage of host tissue symptomatic of BSR. Comparison of SCN-resistant cultivars and plant introductions (PI) to standard BSR-resistant and -susceptible checks were conducted in two greenhouse experiments using a root-dip inoculation with a single isolate of P. gregata. For both greenhouse experiments, PI 209332 was the only source of SCN resistance with resistance to BSR similar to standard BSR-resistant checks. Nine other sources of SCN resistance, including PI 88788 and Peking, expressed BSR symptom severity similar to BSR-susceptible checks. Cultivars derived from most SCN-resistant sources, including PI 209332, also were susceptible to BSR development, while four of the five cultivars derived from PI 88788 were highly resistant to BSR development. SCN-resistant cultivars derived from PI 88788, Peking, and PI 209332 were planted along with standard BSR-resistant and -susceptible checks at two field locations naturally infested with P gregata and SCN or P. gregata alone. As in greenhouse experiments, four of the five cultivars derived from PI 88788 expressed resistance to BSR development equal to or better than standard BSR-resistant checks at both locations. In contrast, cultivars derived from PI 209332 and Peking expressed varying levels of disease development depending on field environment. Yields observed for PI 88788-derived cultivars were higher than BSR-resistant checks regardless of the presence of SCN. Data from both greenhouse and field experiments suggest that cvs. Williams and Williams 82 may contain a gene or genes for BSR resistance that require one or more modifier genes, possibly located in the genome of PI 88788, for complete expression.},

	Abstract = {A solid-phase subtractive strategy was used to clone parasitism gene candidates (PGCs) expressed in the oesophageal gland cells of Meloidogyne incognita. Nematode intestinal first-strand cDNA was synthesized directly on magnetic beads and used to enrich for gland-specific sequences by high stringency hybridization to gland-cell mRNA. A gland-specific cDNA library was created from the nonhybridizing gland-cell mRNA by long-distance reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Subtraction of the gland cDNA library (1000 clones) with previously cloned M. incognita parasitism genes removed 89 cDNA clones and promoted efficient identification of new PGCs. Sequencing of 711 cDNA clones from the subtracted library revealed that deduced protein sequences of 67 cDNAs were preceded by a signal peptide for secretion, a key criterion for parasitism genes. In situ hybridization with probes from the cDNA clones encoding signal peptides showed that seven cDNA clones were specifically expressed in the subventral gland cells and four in the dorsal gland cell of M. incognita. BLASTP analyses revealed the predicted proteins of five cDNAs to be novel sequences. The six PGCs with similarities to known proteins included a pectate lyase, three beta-1,4-endoglucanases and two chorismate mutases. This subtractive protocol provides an efficient and reliable approach for identifying PGCs encoding oesophageal gland cell secretory proteins that may have a role in M. incognita parasitism of plants.},

	Abstract = {Soyabean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is one of the most destructive soyabean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] pests worldwide. The most common source of SCN resistance used in soyabean breeding in the northern USA is PI 88788. Previous research has shown that PI 88788 carries a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) conferring SCN resistance on linkage group (LG) G, which is believed to be rhg1. The objective of our research was to map and confirm additional SCN resistance QTL in Bell, a cultivar with resistance from PI 88788. One hundred four F4-derived lines (F4 population) developed from crossing the cultivars Bell and Colfax were tested for associations between 54 molecular markers and resistance to SCN populations PA3 (HG type 7, race 3) and PA14 (HG type 1.3.5.6.7, race 14). Three populations of near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed from F4 plants heterozygous for a region on LG J where a significant QTL was identified in the F4 population. The NIL populations were tested with genetic markers and also for resistance to both SCN populations. In the F4 population, SCN resistance QTL were identified at both rhg1 and on LG J. The LG J QTL was confirmed in NIL populations and was given the confirmed QTL designation cqSCN-003. The effect of cqSCN-003 was diminished in the NIL populations compared to the F4 population. This was at least partially the result of segregation distortion in the F4 population between the region containing rhg1 and the region containing cqSCN-003. These results show the importance of verifying QTL in confirmation populations to estimate accurately their effects.},

The gene structures of three, hg-eng-4, hg-eng-5 and hg-eng-6, of the six beta-1,4-endoglucanase genes, all family 5 glycosyl hydrolases previously identified from H. glycines, are presented here. Furthermore, we present the detailed expression analyses of beta-1,4-endoglucanase genes as well as the biochemical properties of four H. glycines endoglucanase enzymes. Two of the endoglucanases, HG-ENG-5 and HG-ENG-6, differed significantly in their amino acid sequence of the catalytic domains and their gene structure from that of the other four beta-1,4-endoglucanases. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed distinct developmental expression differences among the hg-eng family members during the early stages of parasitism and relatively low expression levels in late parasitic stages, with the exception of the adult male stage for some eng genes. Recombinant HG-ENGs degraded carboxymethylcellulose and optimum enzyme activity ranged from pH 5.5 for HG-ENG-5 to pH 8 for HG-ENG-6. EDTA, Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+ and Fe2+ did not affect enzyme activity of any ENG protein, whereas Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ inhibited enzyme activity from 23% to 73% in some cases. In tests with 12 different polysaccharide substrates, enzyme activity was restricted to beta-1,4 linkages with all ENG proteins tested. Only HG-ENG-5 and HG-ENG-6 had relatively high activity on xylan and slightly degraded microcrystalline cellulose. Together, these data reveal distinct differences in expression and biochemistry of cyst nematode parasitism genes and proteins, respectively, and cast light on the intricate interactions between a parasitic animal and its plant host.},

The cDNA hybridised to genomic DNA of H. glycines in Southern blots, and the genomic sequence of Hg-cbp-1 contained only one intron. The Hg-cbp-1 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding 132 amino acids, with a predicted signal peptide sequence for secretion and a cellulose-binding domain. Bacterial expressed recombinant HG-CBP-1, minus the signal peptide sequence, had no hydrolytic activity on carboxymethyl -cellulose but was able to bind to cellulose.

The recent isolation of multiple 'parasitism genes' expressed specifically within the esophageal gland cells of sedentary phytonematodes suggests that an arsenal of different secreted parasitism proteins from the nematode might have direct effects on recipient host cells. These include cell wall modifications and potential interactions with signal transduction receptors in the extracellular space, as well as direct introduction of proteins into host cells that might influence cellular metabolism, the cell cycle, selective protein degradation, a localized defense response and regulatory activity within the host cell nucleus.},

	Abstract = {Soyabean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe), the most destructive pest of soyabean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], is estimated to be responsible for almost nine million megagrams in annual yield loss worldwide. Host plant resistance is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of controlling SCN. Resistance is present among soyabean plant introductions (PIs) and related wild species, such as Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc. Molecular marker technology has ushered in a decade devoted to the identification and characterization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying SCN. These genetic mapping efforts uncovered numerous locations of SCN resistance QTL in many PIs. In more than a decade of mapping SCN resistance QTL, there is some consistency in the results. In almost all studies involving various sources of resistance, the QTL conferring the greatest level of resistance mapped to the region containing rhg1 on linkage group (LG) G. In addition, a major resistance QTL was mapped in many sources to the region containing Rhg4 on LG A2. The mapping of QTL to these regions from many sources suggests that these sources may have resistance genes in common, which has caused concern over the possible dependence on a few resistance genes. Recently, two independent research groups reported cloning candidate genes for rhg1 and Rhg4. Despite these advances, there is some degree of trepidation, especially in the public sector, on the use of rhg1 and Rhg4 genetic mapping and cloning information in SCN resistance breeding because of intellectual property issues.},

	Abstract = {Iron-deficiency chlorosis (IDC) and soybean cyst nematode (SCN) result in yield and income losses for soybean growers in the U.S. Breeding programs are identifying soybean genotypes with resistance to IDC using calcareous soils infested with SCN, where SCN might interfere with evaluation. Our first objective was to examine whether associations could be established for chlorosis symptoms with SCN infestation of soybean grown on SCN-infested calcareous soils. Two breeding populations, their parents, and five SCN-susceptible, IDC-control genotypes (IDC controls) were evaluated for IDC symptoms on SCN-infested calcareous soils in 2000 and 2001. In general, no significant correlations were detected between chlorosis expression and SCN infestation in either year, although a negative correlation (r = - 0.93, p less than or equal to 0.05) was observed for the IDC controls in 2001. For our second objective, we examined the relationship between genotype resistance to SCN and IDC. Although IDC controls were all equally susceptible to SCN and chlorosis observed in the field and nutrient solution was similar, SCN-resistant genotypes expressed resistance to IDC in the field, but severe susceptibility to IDC in nutrient solution. Our third objective was to investigate the value of calcareous soil properties to predict IDC in soybean grown on SCN-infested calcareous soils. For one breeding population in 2001, positive correlations (p less than or equal to 0.05) were detected for chlorosis with calcium carbonate (r = 0.62) and electrical conductivity (r = 0.59), and a negative correlation (r = -0.41) with soil Fe-DTPA-TEA. No significant correlations were observed for the remaining genotypes. Our study indicated that associations between IDC, SCN, and calcareous soil properties are dependent on genotype and environment. In addition, our study demonstrated a potential association between plant health and SCN reproduction in SCN-susceptible genotypes, the possibility that SCN-resistant genotypes may be sensitive to iron availability, and the importance of genotype on the detection of associations between IDC expression and SCN infestation.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this work was to identify microsatellite markers linked to a gene for resistance to soyabean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) in soyabean cv. Hartwig. A BC1F2 mapping population derived from a cross between Hartwig (resistant) and the Brazilian soyabean line Y23 (susceptible) was used. Approximately 200 microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs were tested in a bulked segregant analysis (BSA). Those that showed clear polymorphisms were amplified in the BC1F2 population, which had been previously inoculated and evaluated for resistance/susceptibility to SCN Race 3. Three SSR markers linked to SCN resistance were detected in the population. Two of them, Satt 038 and Satt 163, flanking a dominant resistant gene (d/a=-0.90), explained 37% of the phenotypic variance. This gene was mapped at the edge of molecular linkage group G. Broad and narrow sense heritabilities were estimated to be 50.54 and 37.73%, respectively. A selection efficiency of 91.18% was obtained with the simultaneous use of the two markers. The identified SSR markers will be useful tools for assisting the selection of homozygous genotypes and for expediting the introgression of the SCN resistance locus from cv. Hartwig to soyabean elite cultivars.},

Hence, much emphasis has been placed on identifying proteins that are secreted by the nematode during the migratory phase. Further progress in understanding the signaling events has been made recently by studying the host response. Striking parallels can be drawn between the nematode-plant interaction and plant symbioses with other microorganisms, and evidence is emerging to suggest that nematodes acquired components of their parasitic armory from those microbes.},

This relationship has implications, contradicting classical views, for evolution of the stomatostylet and homology with the cephalobid stoma. Emerging evidence from comparative TEM and 3D modelling is the basis for hypothesising that the tylenchid stylet, specifically the cone and shaft, is homologous with cuticle associated with arcade syncytia of the cephalobid gymnostom; furthermore, the stylet knobs and associated m1 protractors, are prostegostom. The guiding apparatus through which the stylet moves is lined by epidermal syncytia and is homologous with the cephalobid cheilostom. Junctional complexes associated with the epidermal syncytia of the cheilostom and adjacent gymnostom arcade cells occur in both cephalobids and tylenchids, but in the latter the membrane complexes are folded and modified as the guide ring. Testing of the hypothesis requires clearer phylogenetic resolution as well as additional ultrastructural and developmental observations of representatives of tylenchids and outgroups.},

	Abstract = {Despite extraordinary diversity of free-living species, a comparatively small fraction of nematodes are parasites of plants. These parasites represent at least three disparate clades in the nematode tree of life, as inferred from rRNA sequences. Plant parasites share functional similarities regarding feeding, but many similarities in feeding structures result from convergent evolution and have fundamentally different developmental origins. Although Tylenchida rRNA phylogenies are not fully resolved, they strongly support convergent evolution of sedentary endoparasitism and plant nurse cells in cyst and root-knot nematodes. This result has critical implications for using model systems and genomics to identify and characterize parasitism genes for representatives of this clade. Phylogenetic studies reveal that plant parasites have rich and complex evolutionary histories that involve multiple transitions to plant parasitism and the possible use of genes obtained by horizontal transfer from prokaryotes. Developing a fuller understanding of plant parasitism will require integrating more comprehensive and resolved phylogenies with appropriate choices of model organisms and comparative evolutionary methods.},

	Abstract = {Evidence suggests that variation in soil texture may be key to explain the variability of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) population density within infested fields and may be important to the delineation of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) management zones. The purpose of this work was to assess the spatial structure of soil texture in two fields of known SCN population density and its relationship to published soil survey maps and to quantify the relationship between soil texture and SCN population density variability across fields and over time. Cysts were extracted by elutriation from single-core soil samples collected in a geostatistical sampling design. Soil texture analysis was performed using a modified hydrometer method. Classical and geostatistical tools were employed to characterize and map soil texture and correlate sand, silt, and clay with SCN population. Cyst population density was consistently higher in loamy sand than in sandy clay loam. Sand, clay, and silt in the soil were spatially structured and strongly correlated with SCN population density consistently over time. The number of eggs per cyst was not related to soil type or texture. This study demonstrates the value of soil survey maps as indicators of where SCN can be expected in an infested field and how the addition of site-specific texture data can improve the spatial prediction of SCN. This study provides the basis for future experimentation to define soil texture tolerance limits for SCN and lays out foundations for new and integrated approaches to site-specific management of SCN.},

Yield was negatively correlated with SCN.

Studies also were conducted to determine the host specificity of Pasteuria. The endospores that attached to the cuticle of second-stage juveniles (J2) of H. glycines in soil did not germinate until the encumbered nematodes invaded soybean roots. Thereafter, the bacterium developed and completed its life cycle only in females. The stages of endosporogenesis were typical of Pasteuria spp. The mature endospore, like that of P. nishizawae, the only other Pasteuria known to infect H. glycines, produces an epicortical layer that completely surrounds the cortex, an outer spore coat that tapers progressively from the top to the base of the central body, and a double basal adhesion layer. However, subtle differences exist between the Pasteuria from North America and P. nishizawae with regard to size of the central body, nature and function of the mesosomes observed in the earlier stages of endosporogenesis, and appearance of the fibers lining the basal adhesion layer and the exosporium of the mature endospore. Endospores of the North American Pasteuria attached to J2 of H. schachtii, H. trifolii, and H. lespedezae but not to Meloidogyne arenaria race 1, Tylenchorhynchus nudus, and Labronema sp. Results from this study indicate that the North American Pasteuria is more similar to P. nishizawae than to any other known member of the genus.

Crosses of PI 89772 X 'Lee 68', PI 88788 X PI 89772, and 'Lee 68' X PI 209332 were made in the field and greenhouse. Several F, and F 2 families from each cross, 98 F, families from cross PI 89772 X 'Lee 68', 74 F-3 families from cross PI 88788 x PI 89772, and 80 F-3 families from cross 'Lee 68' X PI 209332 were tested with an inbred line of H. glycines developed on PI 88788 to determine the level and inheritance of resistance. Approximately 8,000 individual plants growing in pots containing 200 cm(3) of sterilized sand were inoculated with 4,000 eggs and J2/pot. Thirty days after inoculation the number of females that developed on each plant was determined. Cluster analysis revealed sets of families with a low mean number of females and low variance, intermediate means and high variance, and high means with a low variance, indicating F, plants came from, respectively, homozygous resistant, heterozygous or segregating, and homozygous susceptible F, plants. Thus, resistance classes were considered as quantitative parameters having different levels of resistance as opposed to only two classes, either resistant or susceptible. Chi-square analysis of segregation of phenotypic data indicated two genes confer resistance to race 3 of H. glycines. The three H. glycines-resistant parents have at least two genes that express resistance to H. glycines. One gene acts as a major gene (Rhg(x)) and the other a minor gene (Rhg(gamma)) in conferring resistance of the parents PI 89772 (Rhg(x17)Rhg(x17)Rhg(y17)Rhg(y17)), PI 88788 (Rhg(x27)Rhg(x27)Rhg(y27), Rhg(y27)), and PI 209332 (Rhg(x37)Rhg(x37)Rhg(y37)Rhg(y37)) to H. glycines race I The same genes may occur in PI 209332 as in PI 89772, but support for this hypothesis must be obtained by studying the cross PI 209332 X PI 89772. The same major (Rhg(x)) and minor (Rhg(y)) genes occur in PI 89772 (Rhg(x17)Rhg(x17)Rhg(y17)Rhg(y17)) and PI 88788 (Rhg(x27)Rhg(x27)Rhg(y27)Rhg(y27)). The phenotypic ratios obtained in this research indicate that epistasis occurs between gene Rhg(x) and gene Rhg(y). Results from this analysis indicated that the sensitivity of resistant genotypes to the environment is different from that of susceptible genotypes. In addition, a maternal effect was found for the inheritance of resistance of PI 88788 to H. glycines race 3, but not for PI 89772.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines is the most devastating pest of soybean in the U.S.A. The resistance response elicited by SCN in soybean is complex, and genes involved in the response to a large extent are unknown and not well characterized. We constructed cDNA libraries made from mRNA extracted from roots of the resistant soybean Glycine max L. Merr. 'Peking' at 12 h, 2 to 4 days, and 6 to 8 days post inoculation with the soybean cyst nematode, population NL1-RHp, similar to race 3. Expressed sequence tag analysis of the libraries provides rapid discovery of genes involved in the response of soybean to the nematode. A total of 3454 cDNA clones were examined from the three libraries, of which 25 cDNAs were derived from nematode RNA. The levels of certain stress-induced genes such as SAM22 and glutathione S-transferase (GST8) were elevated in the SCN-infected roots relative to uninoculated roots. Early defense response genes, particularly ascorbate peroxidase and lipoxygenase, were abundant in the 12-h library. By 6-8 days, the expression of most of those genes was not as abundant, whereas genes coding for unknown proteins and stress-induced proteins continued to be highly expressed. These ESTs and associated information will be useful to scientists examining gene and protein interactions between nematodes and plants.},

Main plots were subjected to three different tillage systems: conventional tillage (moldboard plowing and disking), ridge tillage, and notillage. Subplots were planted with three different crop sequences: spring cotton and fall corn every year; spring cotton and fall corn in one year, followed by corn for two years; and cotton followed by corn and then grain sorghum, one spring crop per year. The population density of R. reniformis on corn and grain sorghum was low throughout the soil profile. In plots planted with spring cotton and fall corn every year, fewer nematodes were found at depths of 60 to 120 cm in the no-tillage and ridge tillage systems than in the conventional tillage system. Population densities were lower at depths of 0 to 60 cm than at 60 to 120 cm. Soil moisture and cotton root length did not affect nematode population densities in the field. When soil was placed in pots and planted with cotton in the greenhouse, lower population densities developed in soil taken from depths of 0 to 60 cm than in soil from depths of 60 to 120 cm. Final nematode populations were similar in size in soil from the different tillage systems, but reproductive factors were higher in soil from plots with reduced-tillage systems than in soil from plots with conventional tillage. Reduced-tillage practices lowered the risk of increases in R. reniformis populations and reduced population densities following 2 years of nonhosts throughout soil depths, but population densities resurged to the same high levels as in soil planted with cotton every year during one season of cotton.},

A wide range of infestation levels was present at all locations. Two locally adapted cultivars, one resistant to H. glycines, were grown at each location. Cultivars were planted in alternating four-row strips with 76 cm between rows. For each cultivar, 20 1-m-long single-row plots were sampled every 2 weeks starting 4 weeks after planting. Infection by H. glycines reduced plant height and leaf and stem weight on the resistant cultivars in the first 12 weeks after planting, and delayed pod and seed development 12 to 14 weeks after planting. Biomass accumulation was not reduced on the susceptible cultivars until 10 weeks after planting; reduction in pod and seed development occurred throughout the reproductive stages. Susceptible cultivars produced significantly lower yields than resistant cultivars, but the yield reductions were not accompanied by visually detectable symptoms..},

Previous research indicated that soil compaction related directly to disease foliar symptoms. Therefore, we hypothesized that decreasing soil compaction would increase soil porosity and provide a more aerated root zone that would hinder root infection by the fungus and decrease SDS foliar symptom severity. Two experimental areas (110 by 120 m) were established to evaluate the relationship between soil variables and SDS. Across the experimental area, strips (9.14 m wide) were subsoiled perpendicular to soybean rows to a depth of 40 to 45 cm, which alternated with strips that were not tilled. In both 1999 and 2000, subsoiling dramatically reduced foliar symptoms of SDS. Compared with no-till plots, subsoiled plots had lower soil bulk density, greater soil porosity, and less soil moisture. In areas where SDS occurs and soil compaction exists, the use of subsoiling can be used to reduce severity of foliar symptoms of SDS.},

At low to moderate population densities, the nematode is capable of large population increases on susceptible soybean cultivars and high rates of oversummer or overwinter survival in the absence of a host. To improve estimates of H. glycines multiplication and survival rates, egg densities were monitored for 12 cropping sequences across 10 years. Log-linear regression analysis was used to describe and compare density-dependent relationships. Growing-season change in H. glycines egg densities was density-dependent for all crops (susceptible soybean, resistant soybean, and nonhost), with slope estimates for the density-dependent relationship greater for susceptible soybean compared with a non-host crop. Overwinter population change also was density-dependent, with similar declines in survival rates observed for all crops as population densities increased. Survival was greater following susceptible soybean compared with resistant soybean, with an intermediate rate of survival associated with non-host crops. Survival estimates greater than 100% frequently were obtained at low population densities, despite attempts to account for sampling error. Rates of growing-season multiplication and survival, when standardized for population density, declined with year of the study. Standardized overwinter survival rates were inversely related to average daily minimum temperature and monthly snow cover.},

In most tests of H. glycines-susceptible genotypes, incidence and severity of internal stem discoloration, characteristic of BSR, was greater in the presence than in the absence of H. glycines, regardless of susceptibility or resistance to BSR. There was less of an increasing effect of H. glycines on stem symptoms in genotypes resistant to both BSR and H. glycines; however, R gregata colonization of these genotypes was increased. Stems of both a BSR-resistant and a BSR-susceptible genotype were colonized earlier by R gregata in the presence than in the absence of H. glycines.

	Abstract = {With the availability of microarray technology, the expression profiles of thousands of genes can be monitored simultaneously to help determine the mechanisms of these biological processes. We conducted Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analyses of the Arabidopsis -cyst nematode interaction and employed a statistical procedure to analyze the resultant data, which allowed us to identify significant gene expression changes. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays were used to confirm the microarray analyses. The results of the expression profiling revealed 128 genes with altered steady-state mRNA levels following infection by the sugar beet cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii ; BCN), in contrast to only 12 genes that had altered expression following infection by the soybean cyst nematode (H. glycines ; SCN). The expression of these 12 genes also changed following infection by BCN, i.e. we did not identify any genes regulated exclusively by SCN. The identification of 116 genes whose expression changes during successful cyst nematode parasitism by BCN suggests a potential involvement of these genes in the infection events starting with successful syncytium induction. Further characterization of these genes will permit the formulation of testable hypotheses to explain successful cyst nematode parasitism.},

	Abstract = {Pasteuria spp. include endospore-forming bacterial pathogens of cladoceran crustaceans and plant-parasitic nematodes. Propagation of these nematode pathogens requires attachment of soilborne endospores to nematode hosts, infection, growth, sporulation, and release of endospores to repeat the cycle of infection and propagation. The ability of these bacteria to Suppress the levels of plant-parasitic nematodes in the field has made them particularly promising candidates for biocontrol of nematode diseases of plants. Genes encoding 16S ribosomal RNA have been sequenced for the cladoceran (water flea) parasite and type species, Pasteuria ramosa, and for Pasteuria spp. isolated front root-knot (Meloidogyne arenaria race I and Meloidogyne sp.), soybean cyst (Heterodera glycines), and sting (Belonolaimus longicaudatus) nematodes. These have provided a phylogenetic basis for their designation to a distinct clade within the family Alicyclobacillaceae of the gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria. Two apparent. biotypes of P. penetrans demonstrating a host preference for different Meloidogyne spp. showed identical 16S rDNA sequences, suggesting host-recognition evolves within a given species. The sequences of genes encoding sporulation transcription factors, sigE and sigF, from P. penetrans biotype P-20 show different phylogenetic relationships to other endospore-forming bacteria, supporting their application to further discriminate Pasteuria spp. and biotypes. Distribution of an adhesin-associated epitope on polypeptides from different Pasteuria isolates provides an immunochemical approach to differentiate species and biotypes with specific host preferences. Application of bioinformatics to genomic data, as well as further characterization of the biochemical basis for host recognition, will facilitate development of Pasteuria spp. as benign alternatives to chemical nematicides.},

	Abstract = {The biodiversity of soil-inhabiting nematodes in Canada is incompletely known, as large areas of Canada's landmass have not been surveyed for nematode fauna. Nematodes considered as indigenous are generally well adapted to a variety of ecological niches and climatic zones. Much of the available information is based on agricultural ecosystems and agricultural species, and thus is biased toward conditions in disturbed ecosystems and away from "primeval" ecology. Introduced nematode species are frequently quite pathogenic, even to exotic host plants from the same geographic point of origin. Estimates of crop loss due to single species infestations of pathogenic nematodes and the costs of nematode control using chemicals are reasonably well known, averaging about 10% of crop value, but ranging to 100% depending on the situation; the cost of damage by multiple-species infestations is less defined. Nematode-suppressive mechanisms are understood in only a few plant species; sulfur appears to be important as a constituent of active compounds in suppressive plants of agricultural origin. Similarly, some native plants are equally adapted with allelopathic chemicals that suppress nematodes. Management of nematode populations in agricultural soils by integrated crop management methods is at an early stage, requiring research to quantify effects of nematode-suppressive plants and soil amendments containing nitrogen. An integrated program could include nematode-suppressive plants, appropriate soil amendments, and the promotion of microbial antagonists. Different mathematical methods may be required to analyze and explain multi-factor nematode control systems. Less-toxic management systems could benefit the soil-inhabiting nematodes that predate arthropod soil pests. Further research on soil-borne nematodes may demonstrate the value of nematodes as indicators of agroecosystern health and environmental pollutants.},

This study used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to examine the variation in Mj-cm-1 transcript levels over six timepoints in the nematode lifecycle: egg, infective second-stage ;juveniles (Inf-J2), 2-day post-inoculation (pi), 7-day pi, 14-day pi, and adult. The Mj-cm-1 mRNA levels peaked at 2-day pi, about 100-fold above levels expressed at the egg and lnf-J2 stages. Some expression of Mj-cm-1 remained during the 7-day pi, 14-day pi, and adult stages. High transcript levels of the beta-actin control gene M. javanica Beta-actin-1 (Mj-ba-1) demonstrated the presence of cDNA at all timepoints. The peak in Mj-cm-1 transcript expression at 2-day pi as well as the previously shown esophageal gland localization of Mj-cm-1 mRNA suggest that the product of this gene may be involved early in the establishment of parasitism.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, causes economically significant damage to soybeans (Glycine max) in many parts of the world. The cysts of this nematode can remain quiescent in soils for many years as a reservoir of infection for future crops. To investigate bacterial communities associated with SCN cysts, cysts were obtained from eight SCN-infested farms in southern Ontario, Canada, and analyzed by culture-dependent and -independent means. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations of cyst contents revealed a microbial flora located on the cyst exterior, within a polymer plug region and within the cyst. Microscopic counts using 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazine-2-yl)aminofluorescein staining and in situ hybridization (EUB 338) indicated that the cysts contained (2.6 +/- 0.5) x 10(5) bacteria (mean +/- standard deviation) with various cellular morphologies. Filamentous fungi were also observed. Live-dead staining indicated that the majority of cyst bacteria were viable. The probe Nile red also bound to the interior polymer, indicating that it is lipid rich in nature. Bacterial community profiles determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis were simple in composition. Bands shared by all eight samples included the actinobacterium genera Actinomadura and Streptomyces. A collection of 290 bacteria were obtained by plating macerated surface-sterilized cysts onto nutrient broth yeast extract agar or on actinomycete medium. These were clustered into groups of siblings by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR fingerprinting, and representative isolates were tentatively identified on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence. Thirty phylotypes were detected, with the collection dominated by Lysobacter and Variovorax spp. This study has revealed the cysts of this important plant pathogen to be rich in a variety of bacteria, some of which could presumably play a role in the ecology of SCN or have potential as biocontrol agents.},

Either H. glycines-resistant 'Linford' soybean or susceptible 'Williams 82' soybean was rotated with corn and grown on 76-cm-wide rows in both tillage systems. Soybean was planted in 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Yield of Linford was significantly greater than Williams 82 in all years. Soybean yield was affected by tillage in 1999 and 2000. No-tillage production tended to support more reproduction (R = number of eggs at harvest/number of eggs at planting) on both cultivars. The largest R for Williams 82 were in 1998: 58.35 for NT plots and 11.78 for CT plots. For Linford, the largest R were 12.09 for NT plots in 1996, and 3.71 for CT in 1999. When corn was planted, R decreased more in NT. When soybean was planted in years subsequent to 1994, numbers of eggs at harvest (Pf) were greater for Williams 82 NT than for Williams 82 CT or Linford in both tillage systems; however, crop rotation with corn negated these population increases. The soil became suppressive to H. glycines in 1999 and was suppressive in 2000. After the 3 years of continuous soybean, Pf per 250 cm(3) soil were 2,870 for Williams 82 NT, 791 for Williams 82 CT, 544 for Linford NT, and 990 for Linford CT in 2000, compared with Pf of 13,100 for Williams 82 NT, 15,000 for Williams CT, 2,360 for Linford NT, and 2,050 for Linford CT in 1994. Describing population dynamics solely on the basis of R was not adequate, but also required independent examination of initial populations following overwintering and Pf after the growing season. Planting soybean either NT or CT in rotation with corn did not result in long-term increases in numbers of H. glycines eggs.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, is the most economically important pathogen of soybean in Missouri. Knowledge of the nematode's distribution and ability to adapt to resistant varieties is important for determining crop losses and establishing research priorities. No previous surveys of Missouri have provided reliable population density and phenotypic diversity data; therefore, we conducted a random survey to obtain both. Two samples from each of 200 fields were collected; 392 samples were processed for extractions of cysts and eggs. Two hundred and forty seven (63%) of the samples had detectable cyst nematode populations, which ranged from 15 to 149,700 eggs per 250 cm(3) of soil. The lowest average population densities were observed in the east-central region of Missouri (2,260 eggs per 250 cm(3) of soil), and the highest were observed in the northeast (9,238 eggs per 250 cm(3) of soil), but among the eight regions sampled, mean population densities did not differ significantly. These population densities were potentially responsible for losses worth over $58 million in 1999 in Missouri. Race tests were conducted on populations from 183 samples. In order of frequency, races 3, 1, and 2 accounted for 86% of H. glycines populations. Nearly 60% of the populations were virulent (able to produce females) on plant introduction (PI) 88788, which is the source of resistance for most H. glycines-resistant cultivars. More than a third of the populations were virulent on cv. Peking, another common resistance source. Very few populations were virulent on PI 90763 or PI 437654, suggesting that these sources of resistance should be exploited more frequently.},

A single open reading frame was identified. encoding a putative 383-amino acid protein predicted to contain a putative N-terminal short secretion signal peptide, which suggests that Mi-CPL-1 Should function as an extracellular protein. The putative mature enzyme included several conserved amino acid residues/motives, among which the typical catalytic triad of the active site. In situ mRNA hybridization analyses showed that transcripts of Mi-cpl-1 accumulated specifically in the intestinal cells of specimens. which suggests that the protein could be involved in the digestive processes of the nematode. However, expression of Mi-cpl-1 was shown to occur exclusively in the developmental stages which are in close interaction with the root tissues (i.e. second-stage juveniles and females). This may indicate that some function of the cathepsin L cysteine protease in M. incognita is more directly related to the parasitic aspects of the plant-nematode relationship, e.g. pathogenicity and/or evasion of primary host plant defence systems.

Nematodes from a whole root system were counted and infection rates standardized per 1,000 nematodes (per replication) prior to testing the null hypothesis through a lack-of-fit F-test. Although the effect of increasing H. glycines proportions on the infection rate of M. incognita was generally adverse, the rate deviated significantly from a trend of linear decline at the 75% H. glycines level in one of two experiments. All lack-of-fit F-tests for the H. glycines and P. penetrans mix were significant, indicating that infection rates for both nematodes varied considerably across inocula. The infection rate of H. glycines decreased with increasing P. penetrans proportions. The rate of P. penetrans infection increased with increasing H. glycines proportions up to the 50% level, but declined at the 75% level. Competition had no effect on nematode development. The general adverse relationships between M. incognita and H. glycines and those between P. penetrans and H. glycines showed a linear trend. The relationship between H. glycines and P. penetrans indicates that the former may be competitive when present at higher proportions than the latter. In this study we have evaluated nematode competition under controlled conditions and provide results that can form a basis for understanding the physical and physiological trends of multiple nematode interactions.

Developmental dormancy and diapause are important for seasonal survival and long-term longevity of eggs in some species, whereas changing sex ratios may improve survival chances of the next generation in some instances. More direct and immediate responses to environmental conditions include aggregation or the formation of relatively resistant dauer larvae. Many nematodes can undergo temporary quiescence in response to environmental stress, and entry into anhydrobiosis or other extreme states allows long-term survival in unusually stressful environments.

	Abstract = {We previously isolated a partial soybean cDNA clone whose transcript abundance is increased upon infection by the sedentary, endoparasitic soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines. We now isolated the corresponding full-length cDNA and determined that the predicted gene product was similar to the group of cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase/bisphosphoglycerate mutase enzymes (PGM/bPGM; EC 5.4.2.1/5.4.2.4). We designated the corresponding soybean gene GmPGM. PGM and bPGM are key catalysts of glycolysis that have been well characterized in animals but not plants. Using the GmPGM cDNA sequence, we identified a homologous Arabidopsis thaliana gene, which we designated AtPGM. Histochemical GUS analyses of transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing the AtPGM promoter:: GUS construct revealed that the AtPGM promoter directs GUS expression in uninfected plants only to the shoot and root apical meristems. In infected plants, GUS staining also is evident in the nematode feeding structures induced by the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii and by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Furthermore, we discovered that the AtPGM promoter was down-regulated by abscisic acid and hydroxyurea, whereas it was induced by sucrose, oryzalin, and auxin, thereby revealing expression characteristics typical of genes with roles in meristematic cells. Assessment of the auxin-inducible AUX1 gene promoter ( a gene coding for a polar auxin transport protein) similarly revealed feeding cell and meristem expression, suggesting that auxin may be responsible for the observed tissue specificity of the AtPGM promoter. These results provide first insight into the possible roles of PGM/bPGM in plant physiology and in plant-pathogen interactions.},

Alignment of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines) produced two separate contiguous sequences (contigs) and three singletons encoding peptides with high similarity to AKs. One contig, Hg-AK1, had 244 ESTs in the alignment whereas the other, Hg-AK2, had only three; nonetheless, the consensus sequence for Hg-AK1 was Missing much of the 5' end. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to prepare clones that were then sequenced to obtain full-length sequences for both Hg-AK1 and Hg-AK2. Hg-AK1 has an open reading frame of 1080 nucleotides (nt) encoding a protein of 360 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular weight of 40 kDa. The open reading frame for Hg-AK2 is 1221 in, 407 aa, and 46 kDa with a 71% aa identity with Hg-AK1. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that HgAK1 and Hg-AK2 are expressed constiutively throughout the SCN life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of peptide sequences for near full-length nematode contigs and other AKs in the Swisspro database indicates that the nematode AKs evolved from a single gene after divergence of insects and nematodes.},

In the present study, we generated specific antibodies against secreted adhesion molecules to investigate their function in vivo, because these molecules have been demonstrated only in vitro in spite of the importance in the infection processes. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific to S. venezuelensis adhesion molecules inhibited the attachment of adult worms to plastic dishes and the binding of adhesion molecules to rat intestinal epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical study revealed that adhesion molecules were produced by oesophageal glands and were continuously secreted in vivo to line the wall of the tunnels formed by adult worms in the intestinal mucosa.

Conditions for efficient parasitism by root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) of the widely used Lotus "Gifu" ecotype were established. Features of Lotus biology, such as thin and translucent roots, proved ideal for monitoring the progress of nematode infection both on live specimens and post-staining. We examined L. japonicus mutants with nodulation phenotypes. One, har1, which is a hyper-nodulated mutant defective in a CLAVATA1-like receptor kinase gene, was found to be hyperinfected by M. incognita. However, another hypernodulated Lotus mutant exhibited the same level of M. incognita infection as wild-type plants. We also established conditions for infection of Lotus by soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). In contrast to the response to root-knot nematode, the Gifu ecotype is resistant to H. glycines, and elicits a hypersensitive response. This pattern of resistance recapitulates that seen on nematode-resistant soybean plants. We conclude that L. japonicus is a powerful model legume for studying compatible and incompatible plant-nematode interactions.},

The rates of hatching of H. glycines eggs in the root leachates from C. juncea and C. spectabilis were significantly greater than the rates in distilled water and in the leachates from non-host plants. Stimulation of hatching by C. juncea was significantly greater than that by C. spectabilis and similar to that by the host plant, kidney bean. The number of second-stage juveniles that penetrated Crotalaria roots was similar to the number that penetrated soybean roots, but most of the second-stage juveniles in Crotalaria roots did not develop to an advanced stage of growth. The population density of H. glycines in soil in which Crotalaria had been planted decreased significantly compared with that in fallow soil (no plants) in both pot and field plot tests. The effect of planting C. juncea on reduction in population of the nematode in soil was generally greater than that of C. spectabilis.

	Abstract = {Crop rotation is an important management practice in the production of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). For the eastern Great Plains, more information is needed to determine whether current crop rotations are sustainable for soybean production over a long-term period. A field study was conducted in southeastern Kansas from 1979 to 1998 on a Parsons silt loam soil (fine, mixed, thermic, Mollic Albaqualf) to evaluate long-term effects of crop rotation on soybean yield, seed weight, and soil chemical properties. Treatments consisted of three 2-years rotations and one monoculture system: (1) W-S/S (winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean doublecrop)/full-season soybean; (2) W-Fal/S = (winter wheat-summer fallow)/full-season soybean; (3) GS/S = grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)/soybean; (4) S/S = continuous soybean. Full-season soybean yields were compared across all treatments in even-numbered years. On average, crop rotation increased soybean yields 16% compared to monoculture soybean. Full-season soybean yields averaged 1.91 Mg ha(-1) following wheat-double-cropped soybean, 2.09 Mg ha(-1) following wheat-summer fallow, 1.99 Mg ha(-1) following grain sorghum, and 1.68 Mg ha(-1) following soybean. Soybean seed weights were also significantly greater in most years when grown in rotation compared to monoculture soybean. Crop rotation increased total soil C and total soil N concentrations by 25% in the upper soil profile compared to monoculture soybean. Differences in soil values among crop rotations were directly proportional to the total quantity of above-ground crop residues produced. On average, W-S/S, W-Fal/S, and GS/S rotations produced more than 8 Mg ha(-1) of above-ground crop residues for each 2-years cropping cycle compared with only 3 Mg ha(-1) for S/S. In the short-term. benefit of crop rotation was increased soybean yield, which would likely increase soybean profitability. In the long-term, rotations with high residue-producing crops, such as wheat and grain sorghum, significantly increase total soil C and N concentrations over time, which may further improve soil productivity.

	Abstract = {Some plant endoparasitic nematodes are biotrophic and induce remarkable changes in their hosts in order to ensure a continuous supply of food. Proteins secreted from oesophageal gland cells have been implicated in this pathogenic process. A potentially secreted chorismate mutase has been isolated from the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida. The gene encoding this protein is expressed in the subventral oesophageal gland cells of the nematode, and the mRNA derived from this gene is only present in the early parasitic stages. Sequence analysis of this gene shows that, like other genes involved in the host-parasite interaction of plant parasitic nematodes, it is likely to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. The presence of a signal peptide in the deduced amino acid sequence of the G. pallida chorismate mutase and its expression in the subventral oesophageal gland cells suggest that it is secreted from the nematode, pointing to a role for the protein in the host-parasite interaction. The shikimate pathway, of which chorismate mutase is normally a part, is not found in animals but is present in plants and bacteria. In plants it gives rise to a variety of compounds which are important in amino acid synthesis and defence signalling pathways, as well as auxins, which have been implicated in the early development of nematode feeding sites. The potential roles of a nematode chorismate mutase are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Parasitic nematodes that infect humans, animals, and plants cause serious diseases that are deleterious to human health and agricultural productivity. Chemical and biological control methods have reduced the impact of these parasites. However, surviving environmental stages lead to persistent reinfection of host species. In addition, development of resistance to nematicides and anthelmintics by these parasites and reduced availability of some nematicides, for environmental protection, pose significant obstacles for current and future prospects of effective parasite control. Due to marked differences in host species, research on animal and plant parasitic nematodes often proceeds independently. Despite the differences between animals and plants, basic cellular properties are shared among these host organisms. Some common properties may be important for mechanisms [homologous or convergent (homoplastic)] by which nematodes successfully infect these diverse hosts or by which animal and plant hosts resist infections by these pathogens. Here we compare host/parasite interactions between plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) and animal parasitic nematodes, with an emphasis on mammalian hosts (MPN). Similarities and differences are considered in the context of progress on molecular dissection of these interactions. A comprehensive coverage is not possible in the space allotted. Instead, an illustrative approach is used to establish examples that, it is hoped, exemplify the value of the comparative approach.},

Of 2,452 cDNA clones sequenced, deduced protein sequences of 185 cDNAs had a signal peptide for secretion and, thus, could have a role in root-knot nematode parasitism of plants. High-throughput in situ hybridization with cDNA clones encoding signal peptides resulted in probes of 37 unique clones specifically hybridizing to transcripts accumulating within the subventral (13 clones) or dorsal (24 clones) esophageal gland cells of M. incognita. In BLASTP analyses, 73% of the predicted proteins were novel proteins. Those with similarities to known proteins included a pectate lyase, acid phosphatase, and hypothetical proteins from other organisms.

	Abstract = {Parasitism genes expressed in the esophageal gland cells of phytonematodes encode secretions that control the complex process of plant parasitism. In the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, the parasitome, i.e., the secreted products of parasitism genes, facilitate nematode migration in soybean roots and mediate the modification of root cells into elaborate feeding cells required to support the growth and development of the nematode. With very few exceptions, the identities of these secretions are unknown, and the mechanisms of cyst nematode parasitism, therefore, remain obscure. The most direct and efficient approach for cloning parasitism genes and rapidly advancing our understanding of the molecular interactions during nematode parasitism of plants is to create gland cell-specific cDNA libraries using cytoplasm microaspirated from the esophageal gland cells of various parasitic stages. By combining expressed sequence tag analysis of a gland cell cDNA library with high throughput in situ expression localization of clones encoding secretory proteins, we obtained the first comprehensive parasitome profile for a parasitic nematode. We identified 51 new H. glycines gland-expressed candidate parasitism genes, of which 38 genes constitute completely novel sequences. Individual parasitome members showed distinct gland cell expression patterns throughout the parasitic cycle. The parasitome complexity discovered paints a more elaborate picture of host cellular events under specific control by the nematode parasite than previously hypothesized.},

	Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes are obligate plant parasites that alter plant cell growth and development by inducing the formation of giant cells for feeding. Nematodes inject secretions from their esophageal glands through their stylet and into plant cells to induce giant cell formation. Meloidogyne javanica chorismate mutase 1 (MjCM-1) is one such esophageal gland protein likely to be secreted from the nematode as giant cells form. MjCM-1 has two domains, an N-terminal chorismate mutase (CM) domain and a C-terminal region of unknown function. It is the N-terminal CM domain of the protein that is the predominant form produced in root-knot nematodes. Transgenic expression of MjCM-1 in soybean hairy roots results in a phenotype of reduced and aborted lateral roots. Histological studies demonstrate the absence of vascular tissue in hairy roots expressing MjCM-1. The phenotype of MjCM-1 expressed at low levels can be rescued by the addition of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indicating MjCM-1 overexpression reduces IAA biosynthesis. We propose MjCM-1 lowers IAA by causing a competition for chorismate, resulting in an alteration of chorismate-derived metabolites and, ultimately, in plant cell development. Therefore, we hypothesize that MjCM-1 is involved in allowing nematodes to establish a parasitic relationship with the host plant.},

Our objectives were to evaluate advanced cotton breeding lines for resistance and tolerance to M. incognita and to determine if a relationship between resistance and tolerance exists. Reproduction of M. incognita was evaluated on 17 breeding lines, a Susceptible control (Delta and pine Land DP5415), and a resistant control (M-120) in two greenhouse trials with six replications in a randomized complete block design. Two-week-old seedlings were inoculated with 8,000 M. incognita eggs and assessed for egg production 8 weeks later. Reproduction on the resistant control was only 10% of that on the susceptible control. Eight breeding lines Supported 45% to 57% less (P less than or equal to 0.05) nematode reproduction than the Susceptible control, and none of them were as resistant as M-120. Yield was determined in 2001 and 2002 in fumigated ( 1,3-dichloropropene at 56 liters/ha) and nonfumigated plots in a strip-plot design with three replications in a field naturally infested with M. incognita. Yield suppression caused by nematode infection differed among genotypes (P: 0.05 for genotype x fumigation interaction). Six genotypes in 2001 and nine in 2002 were tolerant to M. incognita based on no difference in yield between the fumigated and nonfumigated plots (P greater than or equal to 0.10). However, only three genotypes had no significant yield suppression in both years, of which two also were resistant to M. incognita. Regression analysis indicated that yield Suppression decreased linearly as nematode resistance increased.},

Earlier work with eggs of Heterodera glycines suggests the presence of two chitinous layers but the vitelline layer was not observed. From our observation the outer chitin layer described in past literature is actually a vitelline layer. Histochemical analysis has demonstrated that chitin is absent from the outer envelope. Electron microscope observations of the eggshell show a waxy appearance and osmium staining consistent with that of the proteinaceous vitelline layer found in other nematodes. Lectin localization also shows that the eggshell continues to develop past fertilization with the delivery and integration of eggshell precursors.

Heterodera glycines, soybean cyst nematode, reduces yield of soybean more than any other pathogen in the United States. Field and greenhouse studies were conducted to determine whether preemergence and postemergence herbicides modified the reproduction of H. glycines, and to determine the effects of possible interactive stresses caused by herbicides and H. glycines on soybean growth and yield. Heterodera glycines reproduction factor (Rf) generally was less on resistant than susceptible cultivars, resulting in a yield advantage for resistant cultivars. The yield advantage of resistant cultivars was due to more pods per plant on resistant than susceptible cultivars. Pendimethalin reduced H. glycines Rf on the susceptible cultivars in 1998 at Champaign, Illinois, and in greenhouse studies reduced dry root weight of H. glycines-resistant and susceptible cultivars, therefore reducing Rf on the susceptible cultivars. The interactive stresses from acifluorfen or imazethapyr and H. glycines reduced the dry shoot weight of the resistant cultivar Jack in a greenhouse study.

Although various species exploit all parts of the plant, roots are the major target. Nematodes deploy a broad spectrum of feeding strategies, ranging from simple grazing to the establishment of complex cellular structures (including galls) in host tissues. Various models of feeding site formation have been proposed. and a role for phytohormones has long been speculated. Based on recent molecular evidence we present several scenarios involving phytohormones in the induction of giant cells by root-knot nematodes. The origin of parasitism by nematodes, and the role of horizontal gene transfer from microbes is discussed. Throughout, parallels with aphid-plant interactions are emphasized.

	Abstract = {Parasitism genes from phytoparasitic nematodes are thought to be essential for nematode invasion of the host plant, to help the nematode establish feeding sites, and to aid nematodes in the suppression of host plant defenses. One gene that may play several roles in nematode parasitism is chorismate mutase (CM). This secreted enzyme is produced in the nematode's esophageal glands and appears to function within the plant cell to manipulate the plant's shikimate pathway, which controls plant cell growth, development, structure, and pathogen defense. Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers, we amplified and cloned a chorismate mutase (Hg-cm-1) from Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), and showed it had CM activity. RNA in situ hybridization of Hg-cm-1 cDNA to SCN sections confirms that it is specifically expressed in the nematodes' esophageal glands. DNA gel blots of genomic DNA isolated from SCN inbred lines that have differing virulence on SCN resistant soybean show Hg-cm-1 is a member of a polymorphic gene family. Some Hg-cm family members predominate in SCN inbred lines that are virulent on certain SCN resistant soybean cultivars. The same polymorphisms and correlation with virulence are seen in the Hg-cm-1 expressed in the SCN second-stage juveniles. Based on the enzymatic activity of Hg-cm-1 and the observation that different forms of the mutase are expressed in virulent nematodes, we hypothesize that the Hg-cm-1 is a virulence gene, some forms of which allow SCN to parasitize certain resistant soybean plants.},

These biotrophic organisms include the most widespread and important group of plant pathogens-the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne species-which attack most major crops, as well as thousands of non-crop plant species. Landmark achievements that catalyzed research on these organisms included the discovery of effective nematicides, ectoparasitic forms, elucidation of disease complexes, nematodes as virus vectors, development of host resistance, and new technologies for research. Evolving research thrusts involve interfacing traditional and molecular systematics/diagnostics, adoption of the Caenorhabditis elegans-molecular genetics resource for general nematological research, focus on genetics of parasitism, use of molecular tools in developing host resistance, ecological and quantitative facets, and soil-biology-ecology based integrated management. Educational and international programs are encountering many changes and challenges, as is support for nematology in general.},

	Abstract = {Site-specific management of soybean cyst nematode [Heterodera glycines Ichinohe] (SCN) is plausible if its spatial and temporal dynamics are adequately known and structured. The hypothesis that variation in the spatial distribution of SCN is sufficient in magnitude and structure and sufficiently time invariant to support the use of site-specific management in SCN-infested fields was tested. A nested survey sampling design with distances reduced by geometric progression was applied on two fields in Michigan. Cysts were extracted from single-core soil samples collected before planting in 1999 and 2000, the number of eggs per cyst was estimated, and the number of eggs per sample was obtained by multiplying eggs per cyst by the number of cysts. The distribution of the three variables was characterized using geostatistical tools such as semivariograms, kriging, and cross-correlograms on log-transformed values of the original data. Mean cyst population density ranged from 6 to 33 cysts 100 cm(-3) soil in the two fields. Although the spatial structure of SCN population varied between fields and SCN population density varied between years, the location of areas of high or low cyst density could be identified repeatedly. The reasons why nematodes exhibited an aggregated distribution are not yet understood. The evaluation of factors associated with the determination of SCN spatial distribution is part of an ongoing project toward the development of SCN site-specific management.},

	Abstract = {Molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) can assist soyabean (Glycine max) breeders to combine traits of low heritability, such as yield, with disease resistance. The objective of this study was to identify markers linked to yield QTL in two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (Essex x Forrest (E x F; n=100) and Flyer x Hartwig (F x H; n=94)) that also segregate for soyabean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) resistance genes (rhg1 and Rhg4). Each population was yield tested in four environments in Illinois, USA, between 1996 and 1999. The resistant parents produced lower yields. Heritability of yield across four environments was 47% for E x F and 57% for F x H. Yield was normally distributed in both populations. High yielding, SCN resistant transgressive segregants were not observed. In the E x F RIL population, 134 microsatellite markers were compared against yield by ANOVA and MAPMAKER QTL. Regions associated with yield were identified by SATT294 on linkage group (LG.) C1 (P=0.006, R2=10%), SATT440 on LG. I (P=0.007, R2=10%), and SATT337 on LG. K (P=0.004, R2=10%). Essex provided the beneficial allele at SATT337. Mean yields among F x H RILs were compared against 33 microsatellite markers from LG. K. In addition, 136 markers from randomly selected LGs were compared with extreme phenotypes by bulk segregant analysis. Two regions on LG. K (20 cM apart) associated with yield were identified by SATT326 (P=0.0004, R2=15%) and SATT539 (P=0.0008, R2=14%). Flyer provided both beneficial alleles. Both populations revealed a yield QTL in the interval (5 cM) between SATT337 and SATT326. These populations may share a common allele for yield in this region, given that about 40% of Flyer genome derived from Essex.},

To investigate this possible interaction under controlled conditions, greenhouse experiments were conducted in which Countrymark 316 (R) and Corsoy 79 (S = susceptible to glyphosate and SCN) soybean root and shoot weights were measured in response to three concentrations of race 3 SCN inoculum and five glyphosate doses. Experiments were conducted in which glyphosate was applied 9, 18, or 27 d after inoculation (DAI). Data from SCN treatments in the (S) soybean experiments were regressed on glyphosate dosage and fit to a log-logistic dose-response model. SCN-glyphosate interaction in the (S) soybean variety reduced root dry weight of SCN-inoculated plants 6% compared with noninoculated plants when 1.0 kg/ha glyphosate was applied 18 DAI. The most significant interaction of SCN and glyphosate in the (S) variety occurred when glyphosate was applied 27 DAI the glyphosate dose required to reduce shoot fresh weight 25% was 0.55 kg/ha in the noninoculated control compared with 0.32 kg/ha in plants inoculated with 1,000 SCN eggs/200 cm(3) soil. Glyphosate rates of 0.84 and 1.69 kg/ha reduced root dry weights of Countrymark 316 (R) soybean 10 to 13% at the 18 DAI application timing only.

	Abstract = {Parasitism by the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, has become one of the major limiting factors in soybean production worldwide. A partial HG-gcy-1 cDNA clone was obtained by screening a H. glycines cDNA library with a probe derived from the HG-gcy1 genomic sequence, and HG-gcy-1 full-length cDNA was obtained by nested PCR and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE). Two additional, full-length guanylyl cyclase cDNA clones from H. glycines, named HG-gcy-2 and HG-gcy-3, were recovered directly by screening the H. glycines cDNA library with a probe derived from sequence of the HG-gcy-1 catalytic domain. The encoded proteins of all three HG-gcy genes had an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, an intracellular protein kinase-like domain, and a guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain. The three HG-GCY proteins had conserved cysteine residues to form disulfide bridges within the extracellular domain similar to the predicted ligand-binding domains of other known membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases. mRNA in situ hybridisation detected the expression of HG-gcy-1 and HG-gcy-2 transcripts in specific and different sensory neurons within H. glycines specimens. HG-gcy-3 transcripts were not localised in H. glycines specimens by in situ hybridisation. The discovery of the three guanylyl cyclase genes in H. glycines is the first of its kind in a plant-parasitic nematode and may be representative of a conserved gene family used for chemosensory recognition in parasitic nematodes.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/dextran conjugates up to 12 kDa are taken up from the external medium by certain chemosensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Similar chemoreceptive neurons of the non-feeding infective stage of Heterodera glycines (so bean cyst nematode) fill with FITC and the nuclei of their cell bodies selectively stain with bisbenzimide. The widely used nematicide aldicarb disrupts the chemoreceptive response of H. glycines with 50% inhibition at very low concentrations (ca 1 pM), some 10(-6)-fold lower than required to affect locomotion. Similarly, the anthelmintic levamisole had this effect at 1 nM. Peptides selected as mimetics of aldicarb and levamisole also disrupt chemoreception in H. glycines and Globodera pallida at 10(-3)-fold or lower concentration than required to inhibit locomotion. We propose an uptake pathway for aldicarb, levamisole, peptide mimetics and other soluble molecules by retrograde transport along dendrites of chemoreceptive neurons to the cell bodies and synapses where they act. This may prove to be a general mechanism for the low-dose effects of some nematicides and anthelmintics.},

Crotalaria is a poor host to many plant-parasitic nematodes including Meloidogyne spp., Rotylenchulus reniformis, Radopholus similis, Belonolaimus longicaudatus, and Heterodera glycines. It is also a poor or non-host to a large group of other pests and pathogens, is competitive with weeds without becoming a weed, grows vigorously to provide good ground coverage for soil erosion control, fixes nitrogen, and is a green manure. However, most Crotalaria species are susceptible to Pratylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus sp., Scutellonema sp., and Criconemella spp. The objectives of this review are to summarize the knowledge of the efficacy of Crotalaria spp. for plant-parasitic nematode management, describe the mechanisms of nematode suppression, and outline prospects for using this crop effectively. Crotalaria species are used as preplant cover crops, intercrops, or soil amendments. Variation in nematode suppression by different Crotalaria cropping systems is discussed. The major impediment to using Crotalaria is its short-term effect in agricultural production systems.

	Abstract = {By using differential display, gene expression was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana roots shortly after nematode infection, and a putative pectin acetylesterase (PAE) homolog (DiDi 9C-12) was found to be upregulated. PAEs catalyze the deacetylation of pectin, a major compound of primary cell walls. mRNA in situ hybridization experiments showed that the expression of DiDi 9C-12 was enhanced very early after infection in initiating giant-cells and in cells surrounding the nematodes. Later on, the level of DiDi 9C-12 mRNA was lower in giant-cells and transcripts were mainly found in parenchyma, endodermis, and pericycle cells of the root gall. Twenty days after infection, DiDi 9C-12 transcripts could no longer be detected. DiDi 9C-12 transcripts were also found in young syncytia and in the cells surrounding the expanding syncytium. Our results suggest that plant parasitic nematodes can modulate the rapid growth of the feeding cells and the expansion of the root gall by triggering the expression of DiDi 9C-12. PAEs, which probably act together with a range of other pectin-degrading enzymes, could be involved in softening and loosening the primary cell wall in nematode-infected plant roots.},

	Abstract = {Transgenic resistance often has enhanced efficacy when more than one transgene is expressed. Here we explore the co-delivery of multiple discrete effectors via a single transgene using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence. As an example, we report the co-delivery of two distinct proteinase inhibitors in Nicotiana tabacum var. Xanthi from a bicistronic plant mRNA to examine resistance against plant parasitic nematodes. A cysteine proteinase inhibitor, Oc-IDeltaD86, is translated in a normal cap-dependent manner while translation of the serine proteinase inhibitor, CpTI, from the bicistronic mRNA is IRES-mediated. ELISAs using antibodies confirm the expression of the two inhibitors in aerial and root material and suggest that IRES-mediated expression in the roots is lower than normal cap-dependent expression. Analysis of Globodera tabacum recovered from transgenic Nicotiana expressing two discrete proteinase inhibitors revealed appreciable levels of resistance of up to 51 +/- 3%. Histochemical analysis of animals recovered from transgenic Nicotiana lines expressing Oc-IDeltaD86, via cap-dependent translation revealed a marked reduction in cysteine proteolyti,c activity in comparison to those from control untransformed plants. A less dramatic reduction was observed in similar analysis of serine proteolytic activity of animals recovered from transgenic Nicotiana lines expressing CpTI via IRES-mediated translation. The utility of using an IRES element to deliver a number of discrete anti-pathogen proteins is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Plant parasitic nematodes are refractory to microinjection as a means of introducing RNA and do not show any oral uptake until they are within plants. We have used octopamine to stimulate uptake by preparasitic second stage juveniles of two cyst nematodes, Heterodera glycines and Globodera pallida. This new technique was used to facilitate uptake of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) together with fluoroscein isothiocyanate as a visual marker. Targeting cysteine proteinases did not reduce the number of parasites but caused a shift from the normal female/male ratio of 3:1 to 1:1 by 14 days postinfection (dpi). Exposure of H. glycines to dsRNA corresponding to a newly characterized protein with homology to C-type lectins did not affect sexual fate, but 41% fewer parasites were recovered from the plants. As expected, treatment with dsRNA corresponding to the major sperm protein (MSP) had no effect on either parasite development or sexual fate over 14 days.

	Abstract = {As plant-nematode research continues to use the model host plant Arabidopsis thaliana more and more, we made a detailed life cycle study of Heterodera schachtii on this host, and investigated pharyngeal gland activities at the most crucial steps during the establishment of the parasitic interaction. In our experimental set up, in most cases induction of syncytia occurred during day 2, and the second moult during day 6. In pre-parasitic juveniles, both subventral glands contained numerous secretory granules, which gradually disappeared during intracellular migration of the juvenile through the roots. At the same time, both glands decreased in size and, after induction of the feeding cell, new kinds of secretory granules could be observed in the cytoplasm. During migration and induction of the feeding cell, the dorsal pharyngeal gland continuously increased in size. Secretory granules were already present in the dorsal gland of pre-parasitic juveniles, and a continuous synthesis of these granules was observed thereafter. Once the syncytium was induced, however, different types of secretory granules were formed.},

Pigeon pea is a major crop in Puerto Rico, but little is known concerning the host suitability of pigeon pea for H. glycines. The purpose of this research was to increase the understanding of the host suitability of pigeon pea for H. glycines. Ten pigeon pea cvs. were evaluated in three assays (two field and one greenhouse) for host suitability to the Isabela, Puerto Rico race-2 population of H. glycines. The field assays, a one-replication potted trial and a two-replication plot trial, were done in a H. glycines-infested "Coto" clay soil. The greenhouse assay had six replications and used artificially infested crushed gravel as the potting medium. A few white females were observed on roots of pigeon pea cvs. I-8-3-2, I-13, Cortada, and II-56 in the infested field assays, but none were observed on cvs. PR-147, I-58-3, Blanco de Yauco, Guerrero, I-8-3-1, and Kaki. No H. glycines females were recovered on any pigeon pea cv. in the greenhouse assay. These data indicate that four cultivars; are highly resistant, whereas the other six may be immune. Additional studies with other cvs. and races are necessary to fully understand the host suitability of pigeon pea for H. glycines.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the Puerto Rico race-2 population of H. glycines on yield components of common bean. Three resistant and three non-resistant bean lines were exposed to three infestation densities (0, 4,000, and 8,000 eggs and juveniles per pot) of H. glycines race 2. A factorial arrangement of lines and infestation densities was used in a randomized complete block design with six replications in a greenhouse in Isabela, Puerto Rico, in 2000. Data for seed number, pod number, and seed yield per plant were collected. H. glycines had no effect on any yield component. Observed differences in yield components were due to genotypic factors unrelated to H. glycines. Initial conclusions indicate that H. glycines will not affect yield of common bean in Puerto Rico. Follow-up studies of common bean and H. glycines, using course-textured soils, are recommended.},

Soil amendment with Zn at 0.8 or 1.6 mg/kg of soil alone or in combination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa IE-6S(+) significantly reduced nematode penetration in tomato roots. Zn applied alone did not reduce root infection caused by Macrophomina phaseolina or Fusarium solani but did reduce when used in combination with IE-6S(+) . Soil amendment with Zn at 0.8 or 1.6 mg/kg of soil alone or in conjunction with IE-6S(+) markedly suppressed Rhizoctonia solani infection. Plant height, fresh weight of shoot and protein contents of the leaves substantially improved when used with Zn, however, plants growing in the soil treated with 1.6 mg/kg of Zn in the absence of IE-6S(+) not only reduced plant growth but also showed necrotic symptoms on the leaves. Zn application in the soil decreased populations of IE-6S(+) both in the rhizosphere and root. A positive correlation between bacterial rhizosphere and inner root colonization was also observed. With an increase in nematode densities in the soil, nematode penetration and subsequent galling due to Meloidogyne javanica increased. Regardless of the nematode densities, Zn applied alone or in combination with IE-6S(+) caused marked suppression of M. javanica . At all the population densities of M. javanica , Zn enhanced the efficacy of IE-6S(+) to reduce nematode invasion and subsequent gall development. IE-6S(+) caused significant suppression of soil-borne root-infecting fungi both in Zn-sufficient and Zn-deficient soil although this suppressive effect accentuated in Zn-sufficient soils. In the absence of IE-6S(+) and/or Zn, increased nematode densities in the soil significantly reduced plant height, fresh weight of shoot and protein contents of the shoots. With an increase in nematode densities, populations of IE-6S(+) in the rhizosphere and root increased regardless of the Zn application. However, Zn-deficient soils supported larger populations of IE-6S(+) compared with those of Zn-sufficient soils.},

	Abstract = {Seed coat color in soybeans is determined by the I (Inhibitor) locus. The dominant I allele inhibits seed coat pigmentation, and it has been suggested that there is a correlation between the inhibition of pigmentation by the I allele and chalcone synthase (CHS) gene silencing in the seed coat. Analysis of spontaneous mutations from I to i has shown that these mutations are closely related to the deletion of one of the CHS genes (designated ICHS1). In soybeans with the I/I genotype (cv. Miyagi shirome), a truncated form of the CHS gene (CHS3) is located in an inverse orientation 680 bp upstream of ICHS1, and it was previously suggested that the truncated CHS3-ICHS1 cluster might be involved in CHS gene silencing in the seed coat. In the current study, the truncated CHS3-ICHS1 cluster was compared with the corresponding region of pigmented seed coat mutants in which I had changed to i in Miyagi shirome and in the strain Karikei 584. In the Karikei 584 mutant, the truncated CHS3-ICHS1 cluster was retained and the sequence diverged at a point immediately upstream (32 bp) of this cluster. The sequences upstream of the points of divergence in both mutants almost perfectly matched a part of the registered sequence in a soybean BAC clone containing the soybean cyst nematode resistance-associated gene, and inspection of the sequences suggested that the sequence divergence of the CHS gene in the Karikei 584 and Miyagi shirome mutants was due to an unequal crossing-over via 4-bp or 5-bp short repeats, respectively.},

	Abstract = {This study explored the possibilities that changes in the egg shell/lipid layer electrical potential or pH communicate external hatching conditions to the Heterodera glycines second-stage juvenile (J2) within the mature egg and that electrophysiology could measure effects of chemicals on emergence. Potentials were measured following application of the emergence inducers (ZnSO4 and ZnCl2), ions that do not affect emergence, or synthetic emergence inhibitors. Results were compared with pH measurements and emergence bioassays. Healthy appearing eggs had negative resting potentials. Application of ZnSO4 caused a smooth depolarization. However, eggs containing J2 and immature eggs depolarized to a similar degree when ZnSO4 was added. In addition, ZnSO4, synthetic emergence inhibitors, and CaCl2, caused similar depolarization, and some depolarization was measured in dye-permeable eggs and empty shells. Results suggest that change in cation surface charge contributed to depolarization and that Cl- penetrated the egg shell/lipid layer without causing potential changes. In bioassays, zinc consistently stimulated emergence to a greater degree than H2O, other cations, or buffers, and counteracted emergence inhibitors. Zinc-caused emergence stimulation was independent of pH. In summary, it is concluded that depolarization and pH are not emergence signals and electrophysiology is unlikely to measure effectiveness of emergence stimulators or inhibitors.},

All inoculated plants of R. virginiana and R. eglanteria survived while there were differences in the mortality after inoculation of 12 other Rosa rootstocks or species. Pratylenchus penetrans caused significant reductions in the numbers of the leaves and roots, and in fresh weights of shoots, roots and whole plants of all 14 accessions. Among these species and cultivars, reductions in root number were least for R. virginiana whereas fresh weights of roots, shoots and whole plants were least affected for R. eglanteria, and the greatest reductions were of R. corymbifera cv. Laxa and R. glauca. Plant mortality and the reduction of shoot and plant weights of surviving plants were positively correlated with the reduction in numbers of secondary roots. The numbers of secondary roots at inoculation were negatively correlated with the degree by which plant weight was reduced and with plant mortality observed 50 days later. Differences in tolerance among species as observed by differences in reduction of plant growth parameters were confirmed by differences of the parameters derived from applying the Seinhorst model to the species.},

However, breeding for SCN resistance is difficult and expensive. Fortunately, SCN resistance genes, rhg1 and Rhg4, are generally accepted as a necessity for the development of resistant genotypes. In this study, the resistance of 44 Korean soyabean cultivars to SCN was tested using two molecular markers. Seonheukkong and Pokwangkong were homozygous to the rhg1 gene. Seven cultivars were susceptible to SCN based on Satt309 marker linked rhg1 locus. All the Korean cultivars estimated in this study were recessive homozygous to Rhg4 locus and were susceptible in the PCR reaction using primer 548/563 linked to the Rhg4 locus conferring resistance to SCN race 3. Among the 44 cultivars estimated, 7 cultivars were susceptible to SCN in both Satt309 and primer 548/563 markers. Based on both Satt309 and primer 548/563 markers, there is no resistant cultivar to SCN in Korea. Therefore, SCN resistant cultivars need to be developed in the future. These two markers can be used for improving SCN resistant cultivars.},

	Abstract = {Integrating remote sensing and geogrpahic information systems (GIS) technologies offers tremendous opportunities for farmers to more cost effectively manage the causes of crop stress. Initial soybean cyst nematode (SCN) population densities from 995 2-x-3-m quadrats were obtained from a soybean field near Ames, Iowa, in 2000. The percentage of sunlight reflected from each quadrat was measured weekly using a multispectral radiometer beginning in mid-May and continuing through mid-September. Aerial images were obtained at heights above the field ranging from 45 to 425 m on 12 dates during the soybean growing season. This was accomplished using color film and infrared film in conjunction with a filter to measure reflectance in the near-infrared region (810 nm). Satellite images (Landsat 7) were obtained for five dates during the 2000 growing season. Maps depicting initial SCN population densities, soybean yield, soy oil, and soy protein were generated using the GIS software program ArcView. Percentage reflectance (810 nm), aerial image intensity, and satellite image intensity data then were regressed against soybean yield, soy oil, and soy protein concentrations obtained from each geospatially referenced soybean quadrats. Percentage reflectance measurements explained up to 60% of the variation in initial SCN population densities within soybean quadrats and up to 91% of the variation in soybean yield. Aerial image and satellite image intensities explained up to 80% and 47% of the variation in soybean yield, respectively. Percentage reflectance data also explained 36% and 54% of the variation in oil and protein concentrations of the harvested soybeans, respectively. These results indicate that remote sensing coupled with GIS technologies may provide new tools to detect and quantify SCN population densities and their impacts on the quantity and quality of soybean yield.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode, is a major yield-limiting pathogen in most soybean production areas worldwide. Field populations of H. glycines exhibit diversity in their ability to develop on resistant soybean cultivars. Since 1970, this diversity has been characterized by a bioassay used to assign a race classification to a population. The value of the race scheme is reflected in the number and quality of resistant soybean cultivars that have been developed and released by soybean breeders and nematologists working in concert. However, the race scheme also has been misapplied as a means Of Studying H. glycines genotypes, in part due to the use of the term "race." For fungal and bacterial pathogen species, "race" can theoretically be applied to individuals of a population, thus allowing inference of individual genotypes. Application of a race designation to an individual egg or second-stage juvenile (J2) of H. glycines is not possible because a single J2 cannot be tested on multiple hosts. For other nematode species, "race" is defined by host ranges involving different plant species, whereas the H. glycines race test involves a set of lines of the same plant species. Nonetheless, because H. glycines populations vary in genetic diversity, and this variation has implications for management strategies, a mechanism is needed for documenting and discussing population differences. The HG Type scheme described herein avoids the implication of genetic uniformity or predictability in contrast to the way the race scheme has been used.},

Conserved EREBP domains of these proteins bind to the GCC box, an ethylene-responsive promoter element found in many pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Using degenerate primers to the EREBP domain from diverse plant species, an EREBP homolog was isolated from a soybean cDNA library. Gel mobility-shift assays revealed that the translation product of this cDNA bound specifically to GCC box sequences. We, therefore, named this gene Glycine max ethylene-responsive element-binding protein 1 (GmEREBP1), i.e., a gene coding for the first confirmed GCC box-binding protein of soybean. GmEREBP1 mRNA abundance was analyzed by RNA blot hybridizations in soybean roots and shoots of cultivars Corsoy 79 and Hartwig, which are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). These analyses revealed that GmEREBP1 is expressed in a root-preferential manner and that GmEREBP1 mRNA abundance is changed after H. glycines infection. GmEREBP1 mRNA abundance decreased in infected (susceptible) 'Corsoy 79' roots, whereas it increased in abundance in infected (resistant) 'Hartwig' roots. Furthermore, ethephon treatment repressed GmEREBP1 mRNA accumulation in both cultivars, whereas wounding increased expression in both cultivars. These changes in mRNA steady-state levels suggest that GmEREBP1 plays a role in soybean-H. glycines interactions.},

	Abstract = {Six natural media were examined for growth and sporulation of six isolates of the nematophagous fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis, using solid and/or liquid culture. Twenty carbohydrates, 19 nitrogen (N) compounds, and nine vitamins were also tested for their effects on growth, sporulation, and spore germination of a further three isolates (ATCC46487, OWVT-1 and JA16-1). Variations in nutritional requirements existed among the fungal isolates. In general, V-8 juice agar (VA), cornmeal agar and potato dextrose agar were good media for growth, and malt extract agar, VA and yeast dextrose agar were good for sporulation of all six isolates. Glycogen was the best and sucrose, inulin, D-(+)-trehalose and soluble starch were also good carbon (C) sources for growth and spore germination of the three isolates ATCC46487, OWVT-1 and JA16-1 in both liquid and solid culture. None of the isolates utilized D-(+) xylose as a C source. L-sorbose, D-ribose, citric acid and D-fructose were poor for growth of all isolates. The best C source for sporulation was D-(+)-trehalose for ATCC46487, D-sorbitol for OWVT-1 and D-(+)-cellobiose for JA16-1. Casein was the best N source for growth of ATCC46487 and OWVT-1, while peptone was best for JA16-1. L-asparagine, L-proline, and peptone were also good for growth of all three isolates. L-cystine was not utilized by H. rhossiliensis and DL-methionine inhibited growth of all isolates. Spore germination of all isolates was well supported by most N compounds examined but was inhibited by L-cystine. No significant difference in sporulation of ATCC46487 was observed among the N sources. DL-threonine was the best N source for spore production by OWVT-1 and L-phenylalanine was best for JA16-1. Vitamins generally enhanced fungal growth and sporulation of certain isolates.},

	Abstract = {Proprotein convertases (PCs) are evolutionarily conserved enzymes responsible for processing the precursors of many bioactive peptides in mammals. The invertebrate homologues of PC2 play important roles during development that makes the enzyme a good target for practical applications in pest management. Screening of a plant nematode Heterodera glycines cDNA library resulted in isolation of a full-length clone encoding a PC2-like precursor. The deduced protein (74.2 kD) exhibits strong amino acid homology to all known PC2s, including human, and shares the main structural characteristics: signal peptide; prosegment; catalytic domain, with D/H/S catalytic triad, PC2-specific residues, and 7B2 binding sites; P domain (with RRGDT pentapeptide); and carboxyl terminus. Comparative analysis of PC2s from 15 species discloses the presence of an insert in the catalytic domain unique to nematodes. Expression of PC2-like mRNA found in eggs and juveniles was undetectable in adult stages of H. glycines. Nucleotide analysis reveals distinctive differences in base composition and codon usage between H. glycines and Caenorhabditis elegans PC2s. The H. glycines cDNA clone encoding PC2 is the first one isolated from plant-parasitic nematodes.},

Nematode feeding sites are constructed from plant cells, modified by the nematode to feed itself. Powerful new techniques are allowing us to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that produce the ultrastructural features in nematode feeding cells. Many plant genes that are expressed in feeding sites produced by different nematodes have been identified in several plant species. Nematode-responsive plant genes can now be grouped in categories related to plant developmental pathways and their roles in the making of a feeding site can be illuminated. The black box of how nematodes bring about such elaborate cell differentiation in the plant is also starting to open. Although the information is far from complete, the groundwork is set so that the functions of the plant and nematode genes in feeding site development can begin to be assessed.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines Ichinohe is responsible for substantial economic losses in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr) production throughout the U.S. Results from past efforts to quantify the severity of crop damage resulting from SCN are often subject to variable experimental conditions resulting from differences in weather, soil type, and cultivar Because of the difficulty, in accounting for these variables, a process-oriented crop growth simulation model was chosen as a platform for studying the dynamics of SCN damage and for transferring knowledge between crop production scenarios. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate hypotheses for coupling SCN damage to the process-oriented crop growth model CROPGRO-Soybean. A monomolecular function was used to relate daily, SCN damage to initial population density, of SCN eggs. The equation was incorporated into the crop model in order to test two hypotheses of how SCN damage occurs. The first hypothesis was that SCN reduce daily photosynthesis (Pg), while the second hypothesis was that SCN reduce daily, potential root water uptake (RIVU). Canopy, biomass data collected in 1997 and 1998 from a site in Iowa were used to estimate damage function parameters for two distinct coupling points, one applied to reduce daily, photosynthesis (Pg) and the other applied to reduce daily, potential root water uptake (RWU). Function parameters were estimated by minimizing the log transformation of root mean square error (RAISE) between predicted and measured canopy, biomass collected every 2 weeks during the season in Iowa. Biomass data collected in 1997 and 1998 from an independent site in Missouri were used to validate the SCN damage models. The minimum root mean squared errors (RMSE) of canopy, and grain biomass were 0.245 and 0.198 log(10)(kg ha(-1)), respectively, for the RWU coupling point, and 0.238 and 0. 193 loglo(kg ha(-1)), respectively, for the Pg coupling point at the independent site in Missouri. The damage functions transferred very, well to the independent site. Validation showed that the Pg coupling point represented the variability, of both canopy and final yield data slightly, better than the RIVU coupling point.},

Both organisms are parasites of the citrus fibrous root cortex. Nematode-infected and non-infected root segments were excised from naturally infected field roots and placed on water agar in close proximity to agar plugs Of P. nicotianae and then transferred to a Phytophthora-selective medium. At 10 and 12 days, 50% fewer nematode-infected segments were infected by P. nicotianae than non-infected segments. In whole-plant experiments in glass test tribes, sour orange seedlings were inoculated with two densities (8,000 or 80,000 eggs and second-stage juveniles) of T. semipenetrans, and after establishment of infection were inoculated with two densities (9,000 and 90,000 zoospores) of P. nicotianae. In the first experiment, fungal protein was 53% to 65% lower in the roots infected by both organisms than in roots infected by the fungus only. Compared to plants infected only by P. nicotianae, shoot weights were 33% to 50% greater (P less than or equal to 0.05) in plants infected by both parasites, regardless of inoculum density. Fibrous and tap root weights were 5% to 23% and 19% to 34% greater (P less than or equal to 0.05), respectively, in nematode-fungus combination treatments compared to the fungus alone. A second experiment was conducted, where plants were infected by the fungus, the nematode, both organisms, or neither organism. The soil mixture pH for 50% of the plants was adjusted front 4.5 to 7.0 to favor nematode infection. A higher rate of nematode infection of plants growing at pH 7.0 compared to pH 4.5 resulted in greater suppression of fungal development and greater inhibition of fungal damage to the plant. Compared to plants infected only by P. nicotianae, shoot and root weights were 37% and 33% greater (P less than or equal to 0.05), respectively, in plants infected by both parasites.

Live citrus nematode eggs suppressed mycelial growth of P. nicotianae and E. solani (P less than or equal to 0.05) compared to heat-killed eggs and water controls. Reaction of the fungi to heat-killed eggs was variable. Root-knot nematode eggs had no effect on either P. nicotianae or F. solani mycelial growth.

	Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne javanica) are obligate sedentary endoparasites that must penetrate the host root to initiate their life cycle. Many enzymes are secreted by the nematode to facilitate host penetration; required enzymes may include pectate lyases and cellulases. Using differential screening, a class III pectate lyase, Mj-pel-1 (M. javanica pectate lyase 1), was cloned from a library enriched for esophageal gland genes. DNA gel blotting confirmed that the Mj-pel-1 gene was of nematode origin and a member of a small multigene family. In situ hybridization localized the expression of Mj-pel-1 to the basal cells of the esophageal glands, while immunolocalization detected the protein in the esophageal glands as well as on the exterior of the nematode, confirming that the protein is secreted. When MJ-PEL-1 was expressed in Pichia pastoris, the resulting protein was active. The pH optimum of MJ-PEL-1 was 10.0, and the enzyme was five times more active on pectate than on pectin. Like other class III pectate lyases, MJ-PEL-1 also displayed an absolute requirement for Ca2+. The root-knot nematode migrates through the middle lamella of the plant root; therefore, MJ-PEL-1 may be an important enzyme early in the infection process.},

The array contained both previously described clones (Wang et al. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact 2001, 14, 536544) and uncharacterized cDNAs. Fluorescent probes for array hybridization were prepared using RNA polymerase amplification of nematode mRNA. Developmental expression profiles of the arrayed cDNAs were determined by hybridizing the microarray with probes from parasitic and non-parasitic H. glycines life stages. Distinct patterns of developmental expression were ascertained for the previously described gland expressed genes, In addition, four H. glycines cDNAs (SCN1018, SCN11020, SCN1028 and SCN1167) were identified that showed up-regulation in one or more parasitic life stages. Clone SCN1018 encodes a C-type lectin domain and is expressed in the hypodermis of females. Clone SCN1020 encodes a probable S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Clone SCN1028 encodes a piwi protein with high similarity to the germ-line-specific protein R06C7.1 of Caenorhabditis elegans. The sequence of SCN1167 had no similarity to known genes. This paper describes the first use of cDNA microarrays to analyse genes of a plant-parasitic nematode and establishes a functional method to mine nematode cDNA libraries.},

Each spring and fall, soil samples were taken from each plot and race tests were conducted to evaluate effects of cultivar and time of sampling. Field experiments were paired field plots rotated annually with corn since 1991. Cultivars included at the northern and central Missouri sites were Williams 82 (susceptible to H. glycines), Linford (PI 88788 source of resistance), MFA 9043 (Peking) replaced by Morsoy 9345 (Peking and PI 88788) from 1995 to 1997, and Jackson II (Peking + PI 88788) replaced by Asgrow 3431 (Peking and PI 88788) in 1996-97, Cultivars at the southern Missouri site were Essex or Hutcheson (susceptible to H. glychics), Forrest (Peking), Hartwig (PI 437654), and Rhodes (PI 88788 + Peking). In 1995, race tests were performed at four temperature regimes to determine temperature effects on race designations. Race shifts were not predictable based on the source of resistance of the soybean cultivar planted. Variability in female numbers on Lee 74 among tests caused changes in female indices (FI). Furthermore, race designations were influenced by the time of sampling and temperature at which the race tests were conducted. The variability of H. glycines populations in both field and greenhouse situations diminishes the value of race test results when making cultivar recommendations.},

	Abstract = {During 1996-1997, mycofloras in cysts, females, and eggs of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, were investigated in 45 fields from 26 counties across southern Minnesota, USA. A total of 4500 cysts, 4500 females, and 45,000 eggs were examined, and 62 fungal species were isolated and identified from the nematode. Fungi colonized 55% (29-89%) of cysts with Cylindrocarpon destructans, Fusarium solani, Pyrenochaeta terrestris, Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon olidum the most common. The frequency of fungi encountered in cysts was positively correlated with egg density in fields. Only 3.4% of females were colonized by fungi with Oidiodendron cerealis, F. solani, F. oxysporum, C. destructans, and P. terrestris the most common. Only 1% of eggs yielded fungi with C. destructans, E solani, P. terrestris, Exophiala pisciphila, and F. oxysporum the most common. Average fungal egg-parasitic index (EPI at a scale from 0 to 10 to measure fungal parasitism of eggs) in the fungus-colonized cysts was 2.0, and average EPI in females was 1.8. The EPI was positively correlated with percentage of cysts colonized by fungi and egg density in the fields. The Simpson's diversity index (at a scale from 0 to 1) was low (average 0.25), indicating that fungal community in the cysts was highly diversified and no single species was dominant. Average similarity index (at a scale from 0 to 1) for mycofloras in cysts between fields in Minnesota was 0.53 (range 0.13-0.85). The study demonstrated that the mycofloras in the cysts and females from the Minnesota fields might have limited antagonistic effect on the SCN population.

Evaluating and developing new resistance germplasm sources for soybean breeding is very important to prevent SCN from race shifts and provide durable resistance in soybean. We evaluated a newly found germplasm, soybean plant introduction (PI) 89772, which is resistant to SCN Races 1, 2, 3, 5, and moderately resistant to Race 14. The objectives were to identify molecular markers associated with SCN resistance, investigate resistant allelic relationships, and evaluate marker-assisted selection efficiency. The F-2 and F-2:3 populations were produced by crossing PI 89772 with the susceptible soybean cultivar Hamilton. Thirty-nine restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and 54 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers found to be polymorphic were used to anchor loci conferring resistance to SCN Races 1, 2, 3, and 5. Two to three loci were found to give resistance to each SCN race. We found that resistance loci for different races could be anchored within the same region on linkage group (LG) G. A region on LG B1 was also shared by loci providing resistance to SCN Races 1, 2, and 5. Our results indicated that no single locus could provide complete resistance to any one SCN race. The major loci combinations provided high levels of resistance. We conclude that these markers could be highly useful in marker-assisted selection.},

	Abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max L. Men.) plant introduction (PI) 438489B is a newly found germplasm source that has resistance to multiple soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, SCN) races. We studied the inheritance of resistance to SCN races 1, 2, 3, 5 and 14 in PI 438489B using F-2 and F-2:3 families, which were generated by crossing to the susceptible cultivar 'Hamilton.' The objectives of this study were to investigate the inheritance for resistance to SCN races in PI 438489B, to find molecular markers associated with resistances, and to study the allelic relationships among resistance loci for different SCN races. The results showed that the responses to SCN races were approximately normally distributed with large environmental effects, and were also highly con-elated, which implied that genes giving resistance to different races were similar. The narrow-sense heritabilities of resistance to all five SCN races ranged from 0.55 to 0.88. Fifty one restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and 64 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were found to be polymorphic in the Fz population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance to SCN races were anchored on soybean linkage groups (LGs) A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1a, E and G. These QTLs explained 47.3%, 45.8%, 51.5%, 34.5% and 37.2% of the total phenotypic variances, respectively, for each race we investigated. Some QTLs for different races encompassed the same region of flanking markers; therefore, QTLs for multiple races may be linked or pleiotropic effects may be involved. Some loci provided resistance in a race-specific manner. Resistance to SCN race 14 had a different pattern compared to other races. Our results indicated that resistance to race 14 did not include loci on LGs A2 and G. These flanking markers associated with QTLs could be used to select for resistance to multiple SCN races in soybean breeding programs.},

Twenty CMC-degrading clones were analyzed, and all were either identical or strongly similar to a beta -1,4-endoglucanase gene (HG-eng-2), previously isolated from H, glycines. A subgroup of identical "HG-eng-2-like" clones had considerable differences in the 5' untranslated region compared with HG-eng-2 and were designated HG-eng-3, One H, glycines genomic done contained HG-eng-2 and HG-eng-3 full-length genes, separated by a distance of approximately 8 kb, and a second genomic clone contained two copies of HG-eng-2, separated by approximately 6.5 kb, suggesting the presence of endoglucanase gene clusters in H, glycines. The HG-eng-2 and HG-eng-3 genes were in opposite transcriptional orientation, with considerable nucleotide differences in their 5' flanking regions. The highly conserved nucleotide sequence in the introns and exons and their close proximity within the genome suggest that HG-eng-2 and HG-eng-3 are the products of recent gene duplication and inversion.},

	Abstract = {Previously, we identified Arabidopsis thaliana mutant rhd1-4 as hypersusceptible to the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. We assessed rhd1-4 as well as two other rhd1 alleles and found that each exhibited, in addition to H. schachtii hypersusceptibility, decreased root length, increased root hair length and density, and deformation of the root epidermal cells compared with wildtype A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0). Treatment of rhd1-4 and Col-0 with the ethylene inhibitors 2-aminoethoxyvinylglycine and silver nitrate and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid suggests that the rhd1-4 hypersusceptibility and root morphology phenotypes are the result of an increased ethylene response. Assessment of known ethylene mutants further support the finding that ethylene plays a role in mediating A. thaliana susceptibility to H. schachtii because mutants that overproduce ethylene (eto1-1, eto2, and eto3) are hypersusceptible to H. schachtii and mutants that are ethylene-insensitive (etr1-1, ein2-1, ein3-1, eir1-1, and axr2) are less susceptible to H. schachtii. Because the ethylene mutants tested show altered susceptibility and altered root hair density and length, a discrimination between the effects of altered ethylene signal transduction and root hair density on susceptibility was accomplished by analyzing the ttg and gl2 mutants, which produce ectopic root hairs that result in greatly increased root hair densities while maintaining normal ethylene signal transduction. The observed normal susceptibilities to H. schachtii of ttg and gl2 indicate that increased root hair density, per se, does not cause hypersusceptibility. Furthermore, the results of nematode attraction assays suggest that the hypersusceptibility of rhd1-4 and the ethylene-overproducing mutant eto3 may be the result of increased attraction of H. schachtii-infective juveniles to root exudates of these plants. Our findings indicate that rhd1 is altered in its ethylene response and that ethylene signal transduction positively influences plant susceptibility to cyst nematodes.},

In greenhouse experiments with the same soil, H. schachtii female population densities were similar in suppressive and conducive soil in the first nematode generation but remained low in the suppressive soil compared to significant increase in conducive soil in the second generation. At termination of the experiment, ca. one third of the cysts, but no females from suppressive soil were infested with fungi, whereas fungal-infested females and cysts were rarely found in conducive soil. The most common fungi isolated from infested cysts were Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium sp, nov., and Dactylella oviparasitica, Paecilomyces lilacinus and some nonidentified fungi occurred less frequently. Suppressiveness was transferred at a rate of one cyst from suppressive soil amended to 110 g of H. schachtii-infested conducive soil.

Reproduction of each population on curly dock (Rumex crispus L.), mixed carnation cv. Chaubaud (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) and 14 cultivars of carnation were evaluated according to the number, of females produced in glasshouse tests, On curly dock, five populations (I to 5) of H trifolii consistently reproduced abundantly. while the other three populations (6 to 8) consistently produced significantly fewer females. On cv. Chaubaud, reproduction by each population varied from test to test, and no apparent population groups could be identified. However. on 14 cultivars of carnation, populations 1 to 5 and 6 to 8 could be separated into two distinct groups on six of the cultivars (Blueboy, Peach Majestic, Tasman, Pallas, IMP White Sim and Dart) on which populations 1 to 5 did not reproduce but populations 6 to 8 did. Populations 1 to 5 apparently had more affinity for curly dock than for these six carnation cultivars, which separated these five from populations 6 to 8. DNA analysis with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) consistently revealed that populations 1 to 5 were similar and populations 6 to 8 were similar. These two groups always showed distinctly different AFLP patterns, when multiple selective primer pairs were used. These results indicated that populations I to 5 and 6 to 8 represent two putative host races in clover cyst nematode that can be separated either by host preference test or by AFLP analysis.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is an important soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) pest in the U.S. and throughout the world. Genetic resistance is the primary method for controlling SCN and there is a need to identify new resistance genes. Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc. is the wild ancestor of domesticated soybean and is a potential source of new SCN resistance genes. The goal of this research was to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that provide resistance to SCN Race 3 from the G. soja plant introduction (PI) 468916. Fifty seven F2-derived lines from a cross between the G. soja PI 468916 and the G. max experimental line A81-356022 were tested for resistance to an SCN population with a Race-3 phenotype. These lines were also genotyped with 1,004 genetic markers and resistance genes were mapped by composite interval mapping with the computer program QTL-Cartographer. In the F2 population, three significant (LOD > 3.0) QTLs were detected that explained from 5% to 27% of the variation for Race-3 resistance. The two most significant QTLs identified in the F2 population were tested in a population of 100 BC1F2 plants developed by crossing A81-356022 to a line from the F2 population that carried the two resistance QTLs from G. soja. In the backcross population, both Race-3 resistance QTLs were significant, which confirms the existence of these QTLs.

Searching of various databases, including the Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequence and the large EST datasets from a variety of parasitic nematodes, showed that no similar genes have been identified in other nematodes or in any other eukaryotic organisms. The M. artiellia gene has a typical eukaryotic structure and its mRNA is present in the intestine. The gene is expressed in all life cycle stages tested.

The rotation treatments consisted of velvetbean (Mucuna deeringiana) or cowpea (ligna unguiculata) during the first year, followed in winter by oat (Avena sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rye (Secale cereale), rye grass (Lolium sp.), clover (Trifolium sp.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), lupine (Lupinus sp.) or fallow. Rotation in the second and third year consisted of soybean (Glycine max). Results showed that velvetbean had a generally suppressive effect on populations of root-knot (Meloidogyne incognita), cyst (Heterodera glycines), and stunt (Tylenchorhynchus claytoni) nematodes in soil and roots. It had little effect on populations of Helicotylenchus dihystera. Velvetbean rotations with winter grass species were also effective in reducing nematode population densities in soil. Soybean yields were positively correlated with velvetbean in rotations with winter grass species. High populations of M. incognita were negatively correlated with soybean yields. The use of velvetbean as a rotation crop assures reduction of important plant-parasitic nematodes in soil and an improvement in soybean yield.},

	Abstract = {Infection of the soybean root by the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) induces a well-documented, yet poorly understood, response by the host plant. The plant response, involving the differentiation of a feeding structure, or "syncytium," facilitates the feeding and reproduction of the nematode to the detriment of the host. We used a genetic system involving a single dominant soybean gene conferring susceptibility to an inbred nematode strain, VL1, to characterize the nematode-host interaction in susceptible line PI 89008, The restriction fragment length polymorphism marker pB053, shown to map to a major SCN resistance locus, cosegregates with resistance among F-2 progeny from the PI 89008 x PI 88287 cross. Cytological examination of the infection process confirmed that syncytium development in this genetic system is similar to that reported by others who used noninbred nematode lines. Our study of infected root tissue in the susceptible line PI 89008 revealed a number of genes enhanced in expression. Among these are catalase, cyclin, elongation factor 1 alpha, beta -1,3-endoglucanase, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, heat shock protein 70, late embryonic abundant protein 14, and formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase, all of which we have genetically positioned on the public linkage map of soybean, Formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase was found to be tightly linked with a major quantitative trait locus for SCN resistance. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by others that feeding site development involves the dramatic modulation of gene expression relative to surrounding root cells.},

	Abstract = {A cysteine proteinase inhibitor expressed in potato plants provides the first demonstration that transgenic resistance to nematodes such as the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida can be effective under field conditions. The highest level of resistance obtained in the field for one of the four transformed lines of the normally fully susceptible Solanum tuberosum tuberosum cv. Desiree was 70 +/-9%. The partially resistant cv. Sante that is currently of commercial use in the UK showed a resistance of 85 +/-3%. In containment experiments a change in G. pallida population to one known to be virulent against cv. Sante caused a significant loss of its resistance from 80 +/-4% to only 51 +/-6%. In contrast, the resistance of transgenic Desiree was similar for challenge by the avirulent and virulent populations with values of 68 +/-6% and 71 +/-4%, respectively. Constitutive expression of the cystatin had no detrimental effect on either number or weight of tubers and the weight of the haulm for 3 of the 4 lines in the field. The results establish that transgenic field resistance against G. pallida can be achieved. Clearly food and environmental safety must be assured before commercialisation can be contemplated. However, a prima facie case can be made that the technology is benign and can reduce the use of environmentally hazardous nematicides.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cultivars (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) infected with soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) often show symptoms similar to K deficiency. The objectives of this experiment were to determine if SCN infection affected macronutrient concentrations in soybean seedling vegetative tissues, determine whether increased K fertility can overcome these possible effects, and to determine if these possible effects are localized at the site of infection or expressed systemically throughout the root system. Soybean plants were grown with root systems split into two halves. This allowed differential K (0.2, 2.4 and 6.0 mM K nutrient solutions) and SCN (0 and 15 000 eggs/plant) treatments to be applied to opposite root-halves of the same plant. Thirty days after plants were inoculated with SCN, macronutrient concentrations of shoot and root tissues were determined. Potassium concentration in leaf blades was not affected; but K concentrations in leaf-petiole and stem tissues were increased with SCN infection. Roots infected with SCN contained lower K concentrations than uninfected roots, but only for the 2.4 mM K treatment. Thus, at the medium level of K fertility, SCN reduced K concentration in soybean roots, and increasing K fertility to the high level overcame the effect. Because K concentrations in the shoot tissues were not reduced by SCN infection, above ground portions of the plant may be able to overcome limitations that occur in roots during the first 30 days of infection. Increasing K fertility level in soybean fields may not benefit vegetative growth of soybean infected with SCN.},

	Abstract = {Resistance of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] to cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe), one of the most destructive pathogens affecting soybean, involves a complex genetic system. The identification of QTLs associated with SCN resistance may contribute to the understanding of such system. The objective of this work was to identify and map QTLs for resistance to SCN Race 14 with the aid of molecular markers. BC3F2:3 and F-2:3 populations, both derived from an original cross between resistant cv. Hartwig and the susceptible line BR-92-31983 were screened for resistance to SCN Race 14. Four microsatellite (Satt082, Sat_001, Satt574 and Satt301) and four RAPD markers (OPAA-11(795), OPAE-08(837), OPR-07(548) and OPY-07(2030)) were identified in the BC3F2:3 population using the bulked segregant analysis (BSA) technique. These markers were amplified in 183 F2:3 families and mapped to a locus that accounts for more than 40% of the resistance to SCN Race 14. Selection efficiency based on these markers was similar to that obtained with the conventional method. In the case of the microsatellite markers, which identify homozygous resistant genotypes, the efficiency was even higher. This new QTL has been mapped to the soybean linkage group D2 and, in conjunction with other QTLs already identified for SCN resistance, will certainly contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of resistance of this important disease in soybean.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to compare the overwinter survival of populations of Heterodera glycines at different latitudes in the United States and the effect of changing latitudes before and after the initiation of dormancy. Soil samples infested with H. glycines were collected in August or October in 1992 to 1994 from soybean fields in two to four states (combinations of Arkansas, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin). The samples were mixed thoroughly, divided into subsamples, shipped to an overwinter location, and buried until time for processing. To determine survival, cysts, eggs, and second-stage juveniles were extracted from replicated subsamples and counted each month from December to May. Survival generally was between 50% and 100%, and often was best in the state of origin. In Florida, survival was at the 50 to 100% level in soil from most locations, and in Wisconsin was near 100%. Survival of H. glycines in Arkansas and Missouri varied more than at the other locations. In a separate test, survival in microplots in Arkansas, in a more natural environment than that of buried samples, was 70 to 94% for field isolates from Arkansas. Minnesota, and Missouri and 100% for isolates of races 1, 3, and 14 that had been maintained in a greenhouse for several years. Survival appears to be better than previous tests had indicated. High survival rates require cultivars with high levels of resistance and long-term rotations for management.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode [Heterodera glycines Ichinohe] (SCN) can reduce soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yields. Rotating soybean with a nonhost crop usually reduces SCN populations. Cropping sequence experiments initiated in the early 1980s at two Minnesota locations were monitored in 1996, 1997, and 1998 for changes in SCN egg densities. Cropping sequences were: (i) 5-yr consecutive corn (Zea mays L.) alternated with 5-yr consecutive soybean, (ii) continuous monoculture of each crop, (iii) annual alternation of two cultivars within a continuous monoculture of each crop, and (iv) annual rotation of each crop. In 1989, SCN was detected in several of the plots at both locations. By 1996, all cropping sequences had detectable populations of SCN eggs at both locations, regardless of whether the land had been planted to continuous corn since the early 1980s. Lowest densities of SCN eggs were typically found in cropping sequences that involved continuous corn and where corn had been planted for the last three or more years, whereas highest levels of SCN eggs were found in cropping sequences that involved continuous soybean and where soybean had been planted for the last two or more years. These results suggest planting a nonhost to SCN for as long as 5 Sr on infested land will not eliminate future problems with this pathogen. In addition, the results suggest that at least a portion of the crop sequence effects on yield has a soil microbiological basis involving mechanisms that are specific to a location.},

	Abstract = {An individual soybean breeder can generate over one hundred thousand new genotypes each year. The efficiency of selection in these populations could be improved if these genotypes were effectively screened with one DNA marker that identified an important gene, and if laboratory throughput was high and costs were low. Our aim was to develop a rapid genotyping procedure for resistance to the soybean cyst nematode. A high-throughput genotyping method was developed with fluorogenic probes to distinguish between two insertion polymorphisms in alleles of an AFLP marker that is located about 50 kbp from the Rhg4 gene candidate. The assay uses the 5' exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase in conjunction with fluorogenic probes for each allele. The method can be used for scoring the polymorphism in a recombinant inbred line population and for screening parent lines in a breeding program. The TaqmanTM method of determining genotype was accurate in 90% of scores in the RIL population compared to 95% accuracy with electrophoresis. Among 94 cultivars that are parents in our breeding program allele 2 that is derived from the sources of resistance to SCN was common in resistant cultivars (30 of 56) but rare in susceptible cultivars (3 of 38). Therefore, this method can be applied to automated large-scale genotyping for soybean breeding programs.},

	Abstract = {The conversion of AFLP bands into polymorphic sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers is necessary for high-throughput genotype scoring. Technical hurdles that must be overcome arise from genome complexity (particularly sequence duplication), from the low-molecular-weight nature of the AFLP bands and from the location of the polymorphism within the AFLP band. We generated six STS markers from ten AFLP bands (four AFLPs were from co-dominant pairs of bands) in soybean (Glycine max). The markers were all linked to one of two loci, rhg1 on linkage group G and Rhg4 on linkage group A2, that confer resistance to the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines I.). When the polymorphic AFLP band sequence contained a duplicated sequence or could not be converted to a locus-specific STS marker, direct sequencing of BAC clones anchored to a physical map generated locus-specific flanking sequences at the polymorphic locus. When the polymorphism was adjacent to the restriction site used in the AFLP analysis, single primer extension was performed to reconstruct the polymorphism. The six converted AFLP markers represented 996 bp of sequence from alleles of each of two cultivars and identified eight insertions or deletions, two microsatellites and eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The polymorphic sequences were used to design a non-electrophoretic, fluorometric assay (based on the TaqMan technology) and/or develop electrophoretic STS markers for high-throughput genotype determination during marker-assisted breeding for resistance to cyst nematode. We conclude that the converted AFLP markers contained polymorphism at a 10- to 20-fold higher frequency than expected for adapted soybean cultivars and that the efficiency of AFLP band conversion to STS can be improved using BAC libraries and physical maps. The method provides an efficient tool for SNP and STS discovery suitable for marker-assisted breeding and genomics.},

	Abstract = {Field resistance to cyst nematode (SCN) race 3 (Heterodera glycines I.) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cv 'Forrest' is conditioned by two QTLs: the underlying genes are presumed to include Rhg1 on linkage group G and Rhg4 on linkage group A2. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and two populations of near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived from a cross of Forrest x Essex were used to map the loci affecting resistance to SCN. Bulked segregant analysis, with 512 AFLP primer combinations and microsatellite markers, produced a high-density genetic map for the intervals carrying Rhg1 and Rhg4. The two QTLs involved in resistance to SCN were strongly associated with the AFLP marker E(ATG)M(CGA)87 (P = 0.0001, R-2 = 24.5%) on linkage group G, and the AFLP marker E(CCG)M(AAC)405 (P = 0.0001, R-2 = 26.2%) on linkage group A2. Two-way analysis of variance showed epistasic interaction (P = 0.0001, R-2 = 16%) between the two loci controlling SCN resistance in Essex x Forrest recombinant inbred lines. Considering the two loci as qualitative genes and the resistance as female index FI <5%, jointly the two loci explained over 98% of the resistance. The locations of the two QTLs were confirmed in the NILs populations. Therefore SCN resistance in Forrest x Essex is bigenic. High-efficiency marker-assisted selection can be performed using the markers to develop cultivars with stable resistance to SCN.},

	Abstract = {Plant nematodes are agricultural pests, the control of which relies on chemical nematicides and fumigants that are among the most toxic and environmentally damaging of all agrochemicals. New approaches to control, based on transgenic resistance, would provide important health and environmental benefits. In this chapter we consider briefly some targets for engineering nematode resistance and discuss the use of plant protease inhibitors as anti-feedants. This approach has provided plants that display good levels of resistance against a range of nematode species. To enhance this defence strategy further we are investigating the value of directed evolution to improve the characteristics of protease inhibitors. We describe the approaches of DNA shuffling and phage display that are being used to create and screen variant libraries in the search for inhibitors with improved features.},

	Abstract = {Aminopeptidase-like activities in crude whole body extracts of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant parasitic soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines were examined. General characteristics including pH optima, heat lability, and inactivation of enzyme by organic solvent were the same for the two species. All developmental stages of H. glycines exhibited activity. In older females, activity was present primarily in the eggs. Affinity for the substrate L-alanine-4-nitroanilide was the same regardless of the stage examined, and was similar for the two species (K-m = 2.3 +/- 0.3 mm for C. elegans and 2.9 +/- 0.2 mM for H. glycines). Nearly all (> 95%) of C. elegans aminopeptidase-like activity was present in the soluble fraction of the extract, while H. glycines activity was distributed between the soluble and membrane fractions. Specific activities of the soluble enzymes were highest in C. elegans and H. glycines juveniles. The C. elegans enzyme was susceptible to a number of aminopeptidase inhibitors, particularly to amastatin and leuhistin, each of which inhibited aminopeptidase-like activity more than 90% at 90 mum. In H. glycines, aminopeptidase-like activity was inhibited 39% by amastatin at 900 muM. The apparent molecular weight of the soluble C. elegans enzyme is 70-80 kDa. Some activity in H. glycines is present in the 70-80 kDa range, but most activity (80-90%) is associated with a very high molecular weight (> 240 kDa) component.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) can cause considerable damage to soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], especially in western USA growing areas that are newly infested. The objective of this study was to rind cultural practices that reduce cyst nematode effect on soybean in this region. Four management systems, one having continuous susceptible soybean, a second consisting of a 3-yr rotation with 2 yr of a nonhost crop followed by susceptible soybean, and two 4-yr rotations alternating a susceptible and resistant cultivar with nonhost crops, were investigated at nematode-infested and noninfested locations. One 4-yr rotation had full-season soybean while the other had double-crop soybean. Data included soybean seed yield, yield components, and cyst nematode egg density. Grain yields of full-season, SCN-susceptible 'Stafford' were similar in all rotations at each location. Nonhost crops reduced nematode densities from 4000 eggs 100 cm(-3) in continuously cropped SCN-susceptible plots to 1000 and 500 eggs 100 cm(-3) in 3- and 4-yr rotations, respectively. However, nematode numbers rapidly increased to more than 5000 eggs 100 cm(-3) by seasons end when susceptible soybean was grown. The SCN-susceptible cultivar produced 33% less grain and pods than did the SCN-resistant cultivar, Manokin, at the infested location while the cultivars yielded similarly at the noninfested site. Full-season and double-cropped soybean reacted similarly to SCN. Crop rotation reduced cyst nematode numbers, but this benefit did not reduce yield losses on subsequent SCN-susceptible soybean as numbers rapidly climbed to damaging levels.},

	Abstract = {The fungi, Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Hirsutella minnesotensis, are two endoparasites of second-stage juveniles (J2) of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines. The objective of this study was to screen for effective fungal isolates to control the nematode in laboratory and greenhouse assays. A total of 93 isolates of H. rhossiliensis and 25 isolates of H. minnesotensis were evaluated for parasitism of SCN J2 on cornmeal agar. Percentage of SCN J2 parasitized by the fungi varied among the fungal isolates. Most H. rhossiliensis isolates parasitized a high percentage of J2. The isolates of H. rhossiliensis obtained from bacteria-feeding nematodes, however, generally did not parasitize J2 on agar. H. minnesotensis parasitized fewer J2 on agar than did H. rhossiliensis. Forty isolates of H. rhossiliensis and four isolates of H. minnesotensis that parasitized a high percentage of J2 on agar were evaluated for their biocontrol potential in soil treated with microwave heating. Most isolates selected from the agar assay also parasitized a high percentage of J2 in the soil but there was variation among isolates. Pathogenicity of 14 isolates of H. rhossiliensis and four isolates of H. minnesotensis to the SCN was also investigated in the greenhouse using untreated Weld soil. Most isolates of H. rhossiliensis reduced SCN population density and increased plant growth when compared with 1% corn-grits control (culture media). One isolate (OWVT-1) of H. rhossiliensis reduced the SCN egg density by 95% and J2 density by 98% when compared with the control. Isolates of H. minnesotensis, however, neither reduced SCN density nor increased plant growth in the greenhouse.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, is the foremost pest of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.). The rhg1 allele on linkage group (LG) G and the Rhg4 allele on LG A2 are important in conditioning resistance. Markers closely linked to the Rhg4 locus were used previously to screen a library of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from susceptible 'Williams 82' and identified a single 150-kb BAC, Gm-ISb001-056-G02 (56G2). End-sequenced subclones positioned onto a restriction map provided landmarks for identifying the corresponding region from a BAC library from accession PI 437654 with broad resistance to SCN. Seventy-three PI 437654 BACs were assigned to contigs based upon HindIII restriction fragment profiles. Four contigs represented the PI 437654 counterpart of the 'Williams 82' BAC, with PCR assays connecting these contigs. Some of the markers on the PI 437654 contigs are separated by a greater physical distance than in the 'Williams 82' BAC and some primers amplify bands from BACs in the mid-portion of the connected PI 437654 BAC contigs that are not amplified from the 'Williams 82' BAC. These observations suggest that there is an insertion in the PI 437654 genome relative to the 'Williams 82' genome in the Rhg4 region.},

Five transcripts of FaRP encoding genes, designated gpflp-1 to gpflp-5, were characterised using RACE. In terms of ORFs, gpflp-1 was 444 base pairs (bp) long and coded for four copies of the FaRP, PF3 (KSAYMRFamide) whilst gpflp-2 was 309 bp long and encoded one copy of the peptide, KNKFEFIRFamide. gpflp-3 (420 bp) Encoded two copies of KHEYLRFamide (AF2) and the genes gpflp-4 and gpflp-5 encoded a total of 11 FaRPs, most of which are novel to PCN. FMRFamide-related peptide (FaRP)-like immunoreactivity was observed in both PCN species, Globodera pallida and Globodera rostochiensis, using an antiserum raised against the invertebrate peptide, FMRFamide. Immunopositive neurones were found throughout the central nervous system in the ventral and dorsal nerve cords and the circumpharyngeal. and perianal nerve rings. Reactive neurones were also present peripherally, innervating the highly muscular pharynx with a nerve net and ring-like structures. Positive immunostaining was also observed in neurones running toward the stylet protractor muscles and/or the anterior sensory apparatus. This study implicates a role for FaRPs in feeding, host penetration and sensory function of PCN. This is the first study to characterise FaRP encoding genes from a plant-parasitic nematode using a targeted PCR based RACE approach and further underlines the importance and diversity of this neuropeptide group in the phylum Nematoda.

	Abstract = {A survey was conducted in the food crop production area of western Kenya to characterise the nematode communities in different cropping systems and to monitor the effect of improved fallows on the abundance, diversity and community structure of plant-parasitic nematode assemblages. Soil samples were taken from short-term natural fallows ( 20 years), maize/beans cultivated fields and improved fallows with Crotalaria grahamiana, Sesbania sesban and Tephrosia vogelii. The Shannon diversity index and evenness were used to assess nematode diversity in the different cropping systems. The relationships between plant-parasitic nematodes and the soil physico-chemical properties were investigated with principal component analysis and co-inertia analysis. Planting trees/shrubs as improved fallows in croplands dramatically increased the populations of nematodes in the soil. However, the diversity of plant-parasitic nematodes was reduced. The distribution of plant-parasitic nematodes was correlated with that of some soil physical and chemical properties. Scutellonema spp. were dominant in the improved fallows where the highest values of magnesium and potassium were recorded. The plant-parasitic Dorylaimida (Xiphinema spp. and Paratrichodorus minor) were more abundant in the maize/beans plots and this abundance seemed related to high soil bulk density. Meloidogyne spp. and Rotylenchulus borealis had a strong positive correlation with soil organic matter and clay, and were abundant in the long-term natural fallows. The correlations between soil physico-chemical properties and nematodes indicate that, apart from the direct influence of the host plant, the soil characteristics play an important role in the abundance, distribution and structure of nematode communities. This validates the potential of nematodes as bio-indicator organisms of soil status. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The pharynx of Leptonemella juliae is the first pharynx of Adenophorea that has been reconstructed three-dimensionally using TEM serial sections. It is composed of a slightly swollen corpus, a median narrow isthmus, and a pronounced terminal bulb. At its anterior end, the lumen of the pharynx opens into a small buccal cavity without any specific cuticular differentiation, while at the posterior end it is separated from the intestine by a pharyngeo-intestinal valve. The entire pharynx epithelium is delimited from the pharynx lumen by cuticle and from the remaining body by extracellular matrix. The main cellular components of the pharynx of L. juliae are: the radial epithelio-muscle cells and the marginal cells, two subventral and one dorsal gland cells, the nervous system, which consists of six longitudinal nerves stretching from anterior to posterior, one horseshoe-shaped commissure, three nerve rings, and three pharyngeal sensory structures (PSS). The ultrastructure and location of gland cells, the sensory structure, and the nervous system appear to be character complexes of value for comparative anatomy. A detailed description of the PSS is presented.},

	Abstract = {Cyst nematodes and root-knot nematodes elaborately transform cells within the vascular cylinders of plant roots into enlarged, multinucleate, and metabolically active feeding cells. The giant cells of root-knot nematodes are formed by repeated karyokinesis uncoupled from cytokinesis, whereas the syncytia formed by cyst nematodes arise from coordinated cell wall dissolution and the coalescing of cell cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Both giant cells and syncytia undergo extensive cell wall architectural modifications, including thickening and the formation of numerous ingrowths that increase the plasmalemma surface area for solute uptake. The origin of enzymes involved in these cell wall modifications has been the subject of debate for several decades. Immunolocalization of endo-beta -1,4-glucanases (EGases) secreted from cyst nematodes was observed in root cortical tissue during the intracellular migration of the nematodes, but secretion of cyst nematode EGases into developing syncytia was not detected. We have identified five EGase genes from tobacco that are upregulated within plant roots upon infection by both root-knot and cyst nematodes. In situ localization of tobacco EGase transcripts demonstrated that their expression was specifically and developmentally upregulated within giant cells, syncytia, root tips, and lateral root primordia. These data confirm that cell wall modifications within plant-parasitic-nematode feeding cells arise from cell wall-modifying enzymes of plant, rather than nematode, origin.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of Heterodera glycines spatial patterns were studied under different tillage systems in two naturally infested soybean fields in Iowa from 1994 to 1997. At each location, there were four different tillage treatments (conventional tillage, reduced tillage, ridge tillage, and no tillage). Soil samples were taken from 98 contiguous quadrats (5.2 m(2)) per plot in the fall of 1994, before any tillage was performed, and in the spring of the following 3 years shortly after planting. Cysts were extracted from soil samples by elutriation and counted, and eggs were extracted from cysts and enumerated. Spatial patterns of H. glycines populations were characterized by geostatistical analysis and variance-to-mean (VM) ratios. Semivariance values were calculated for cyst and egg densities and semivariograms were constructed. In general, there was greater spatial dependence among cyst populations than egg populations. In one field with a strongly aggregated initial H. glycines population, tillage practices resulted in changes in spatial patterns of H. glycines populations, characterized by spherical-model semivariogram parameters (sill, nugget effect, and range of spatial dependence). These parameters indicated increasing aggregation over time in no tillage and ridge tillage treatments, but decreasing aggregation in reduced and conventional tillage treatments. There was an increase of 350% in sill values (maximum semivariance) for cyst populations after 3 years of no tillage, but in the conventional tillage treatment, sill values remained unchanged or decreased over time as tillage was implemented. Semivariograms for cyst and egg population densities revealed strong anisotropy (directional spatial dependence) along soybean rows, coincident with the direction of tillage practices. VM ratios for cyst counts increased each year in the no tillage and ridge tillage treatments, but decreased for 2 years in reduced tillage and conventional tillage treatments. Final VM ratios for cyst and egg counts were highest in the no tillage treatment. In a second field, with low initial aggregation of H. glycines populations, there was little measurable change in semivariogram parameters after 3 years of no tillage, but in the conventional tillage treatment, populations became less aggregated, as the range, sill, and the proportion of the sill explained by spatial dependence decreased for cyst population densities. Our results indicated that in soybean fields with initially aggregated populations of H. glycines, no tillage and ridge tillage systems promoted aggregation of the nematode population, whereas conventional and reduced tillage systems resulted in a less aggregated spatial pattern.},

Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) with the microaspirated contents from Heterodera glycines esophageal gland cells and intestinal region was used to isolate genes expressed preferentially in the gland cells of parasitic stages. Twenty-three unique cDNA sequences from a SSH cDNA library were identified and hybridized to the genomic DNA of H. glycines in Southern blots. Full-length cDNAs of 21 clones were obtained by screening a gland-cell long-distance polymerase chain reaction cDNA library. Deduced proteins of 10 clones were preceded by a signal peptide for secretion, and PSORT II computer analysis predicted eight proteins as extracellular, one as nuclear, and one as plasmalemma localized. In situ hybridization showed that four of the predicted extracellular clones were expressed specifically in the dorsal gland cell, one in the subventral gland cells, and three in the intestine In H. glycines. The predicted nuclear clone and the plasmalemma-localized clone were expressed in the subventral gland cells and the dorsal gland cell, respectively.

	Abstract = {Secretory proteins encoded by genes expressed in the oesophageal gland cells of plant-parasitic nematodes have key roles in nematode parasitism of plants. Two venom allergen-like protein cDNAs (designated hg-vap-1 and hg-vap-2)were isolated from Heterodera glycines gland cell cDNA libraries. Both cDNAs hybridised to genomic DNA of H. glycines in Southern blots. The hg-vap-1 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding 215 amino acids with the first 25 amino acids being a putative secretion signal. The hg-vap-2 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding 212 amino acids with the first 19 amino acids being a putative secretion signal. Genes of hg-vap-1 and hg-vap-2 contained four introns, which ranged in size from 44 to 574 bp, and Eve exons ranging in size from 43 to 279 bp. In situ hybridisation analyses showed that mRNAs of both vap genes. accumulated specifically in the subventral gland cells of H. glycines during parasitism. The gland cell-specific expression and presence of predicted secretion signal peptides in both VAPs suggest that these proteins are secreted from the nematode and may play a role in the infection of host plants by this parasite.

	Abstract = {In general, the biological activation of nephrocarcinogenic chlorinated hydrocarbons proceeds via conjugation with glutathione. It has mostly been assumed that the main site of initial conjugation is the liver, followed by a mandatory transfer of intermediates to the kidney. It was therefore of interest to study the enzyme activities of subgroups of glutathione transferases (GSTs) in renal cancers and the surrounding normal renal tissues of the same individuals (n = 21). For genotyping the individuals with respect to known polymorphic GST isozymes the following substrates with differential specificity were used: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene for overall GST activity (except GST theta); 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole for GST alpha; 1,2-dichloro-4-nitro-benzene for GST mu; ethacrynic acid and 4-vinylpyridine for GST pi; and methyl chloride for GST theta. In general, the normal tissues were able to metabolize the test substrates. A general decrease in individual GST enzyme activities was apparent in the course of cancerization, and in some (exceptional) cases individual activities, expressed in the normal renal tissue, were lost in the tumour tissue. The GST enzyme activities in tumours were independent of tumour stage, or the age and gender of the patients. There was little influence of known polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTM3 and GSTP1 upon the activities towards the test substrates, whereas the influence of GSTT1 polymorphism on the activity towards methyl chloride was straightforward. In general, the present findings support the concept that the initial GST-dependent bioactivation step of nephrocarcinogenic chlorinated hydrocarbons may take place in the kidney itself. This should be a consideration in toxicokinetic modelling.},

	Abstract = {Modified Nash and Snyder's medium (MNSM) has been used to study soil populations of the fungus Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, the causal agent of sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean. However, no studies have been conducted to confirm the accuracy of this technique in enumerating the SDS pathogen. To determine what portion of the colonies enumerated on MNSM are the SDS pathogen, 282 isolates resembling F. solani f sp. glycines were collected from soil of two fields with a history of SDS in Arkansas using a soil dilution method with MNSM. The colony morphology of these isolates was compared on MNSM and on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Of these isolates, 112 were tested for pathogenicity on soybean in the greenhouse. In addition to fungi that produced colonies typical of F. solani f, sp. glycines on MNSM, 5 isolates each of four common colony types on MNSM were collected from each field for a total of 40 isolates. These isolates were compared to F. solani f. sp. glycines for colony morphology on PDA and for pathogenicity. Isolates that had colonies on MNSM that resembled F. solani f. sp. glycines had colony morphologies on PDA similar to this pathogen and produced SDS-like foliar symptoms in greenhouse inoculations of soybean. There was a significant quadratic relationship between foliar symptom severity and plant fresh weight. None of the other isolates tested resembled F. solani f. sp. glycines on either MNSM or PDA or produced SDS-foliar symptoms in greenhouse inoculations. These non-SDS isolates were F. solani, F. merismoides, a Pythium sp., and a Paecilomyces sp. All of these isolates produced some root rot, but significantly less than the F. solani f. sp. glycines reference isolate. The results of this study established that soil populations of F. solani f. sp. glycines can be accurately enumerated using MNSM. It should be noted that, on both MNSM and PDA, F. solani f. sp. glycines can resemble some isolates of F. solani f. sp. phaseoli, so pathogenicity tests of random isolates may be required to confirm the forma specialis especially in fields that have a history of both Glycines mar and Phaseolus vulgaris.},

No effects of tillage and raw spacing were observed on nematode population density. As expected, the susceptible cultivar Sturdy consistently supported higher nematode densities than did the resistant cultivar Bell in 1993 to 1995 and Freeborn in 1996. Nematode reproduction varied among years. Predicted nematode density at equilibrium was 3,800, 13,000, 12,000, and 27,000 eggs per 100 cm(3) of soil in plots with the susceptible cultivar and 480, 240, 430, and 700 eggs per 100 cm(3) of soil in plots with the resistant cultivars in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively.

Planting resistant cv. Bell increased the yield of the following susceptible cv. Sturdy compared with continual planting of the susceptible cultivar. A sequence with continued resistant cultivar or cultivars, however, produced a higher overall yield and lower nematode density at the end of the 4-year rotation cycle than any sequence in which the susceptible cultivar was included. Yield bf resistant and susceptible cultivars was negatively related to the SCN initial population density.},

Cropping sequence treatments were (i) monocultures of corn (Zea mays L.), SCN-resistant soybean, and SCN-susceptible soybean; (ii) susceptible soybean rotated with 1, 2, or 3 yr of corn; (iii) resistant soybean rotated annually with corn; and (h) rotation of corn-resistant soybean-corn-susceptible soybean.

Resistant soybean in annual rotation with corn produced the highest yield, and susceptible soybean in monoculture produced the lowest yield among all treatments. A longer period of corn in rotation resulted in higher yield of subsequent susceptible soybean in most instances. Yields of corn following corn were lower than following soybean. Egg density at the start of the study was 6994 and 14 000 eggs 100 cm(-3) soil at Waseca and Lamberton, respectively.

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is a major soybean yield-limiting factor, and the use of resistant cultivars is one of the most effective means to manage the nematode. During the past decade, a number of resistant cultivars in maturity groups I and II have been developed and made available to growers. A total of 47 resistant cultivars and nine susceptible cultivars were evaluated at 15 SON-infested field sites and two noninfested sites during 1996 to 1998 in Minnesota. As expected, more nematodes developed on susceptible cultivars than on resistant cultivars. Egg density on susceptible cultivars increased by 1.9- to 10.6-fold during the growing season at 12 sites and did not change at the other three sites. Average egg density decreased over time for resistant cultivars at all sites, except where the initial egg density was low (less than or equal to 455 eggs per 100 cm(3) soil). Nematode reproduction factors (Rf = egg density at harvest/egg density at planting) for individual resistant and susceptible cultivars were highly consistent across the eight sites where initial SCN density was more than 1,000 eggs per 100 cm(3) soil. Resistance, however. varied among the cultivars, with the average Rf of individual resistant cultivars across the sites ranging from 0.3 to 1.7. Resistant cultivars produced an average yield of 3,082 kg/ha compared with 2,497 kg/ha by susceptible cultivars at eight of 10 sites where egg density at planting was greater than 700 eggs per 100 cm(3) soil. In contrast, no difference in yield was observed between resistant and susceptible cultivars at sites where egg density at planting was lower than 500 eggs per 100 cm3 soil. Yield differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars increased with increasing initial SCN egg density. In six fields infested with initial densities of more than 5,000 eggs per 100 cm(3) soil, resistant cultivars produced 28.4% (676 kg/ha) more yield on average than susceptible cultivars. Soybean yield increased when cultivars with increasing resistance to the SCN (lower Rf or females formed on roots) were grown in fields infested with SCN. Average relative yield (yield of a cultivar/average yield of all resistant cultivars at a site) of individual resistant cultivars across all SON-infested sites ranged from 0.76 to 1.10. Yield consistency of soybean cultivars was low among the different sites, indicating that many other factors affected yield. Our results suggest growing resistant cultivars is an effective method to manage SCN in Minnesota while minimizing yield loss due to SCN.},

	Abstract = {The effects of seed inoculation with the Pseudomonas fluorescens strains F113lacZY [a genetically marked biocontrol agent producing the anti-fungal agent 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG)] and F113G22 [a genetically modified (GM) derivative strain of F113lacZY incapable of producing DAPG] on associated nematode communities were investigated over 17 days of plant growth. Plant growth measurements and colony forming unit counts (CFU) derived from rhizosphere soil indicated only small and transient perturbations as a result of introductions of the GM bacteria. Total nematode numbers were increased significantly in the rhizosphere of inoculated plants compared with the non-inoculated control treatments. These increases were mainly due to increases in bacterial feeding nematodes. This indicates that inoculation with the GM P fluorescens strains induced high bacterial growth rates in the rhizosphere of plants inoculated with these strains. No indication of greater root colonisation by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. could be found using CFU counts on Pseudomonas-selective media. Numbers of fungal feeding nematodes decreased initially, probably as a result of lack of intact hyphae in the soil. However, inoculation with the two different GM P fluorescens strains resulted in a rapid recovery of fungal feeding nematode populations, whereas in the non-inoculated control populations of fungal feeding nematodes remained small. This result is surprising as one of the strains (F113lacZY) produces the anti-fungal agent DAPG and it would be expected that this agent would result in a decrease in fungal activity.},

	Abstract = {Recently, a new race of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines) was discovered, which breaks the resistance of cultivar Hartwig, resistant to all known races of SCN. This population was obtained from soybean plants collected in the Sorriso county, state of Mate Grosso, Brazil, and is characterized as race 4. To verify if this isolate was different from others classified as races 4 and 9, their genetic diversity was analyzed by using the RAPD technique. Nine populations of SCN were analyzed, and only four populations were able to parasitize soybean plants cultivar Hartwig. Based on this study, it was verified that the populations that break Hartwig resistance were different from the other populations. Based on cluster analysis, the populations were separated into three groups. Race 4 populations were placed in the first group, while the race 9 population was placed in the second group and those capable of breaking cultivar Hartwig's resistance were placed in group three. This work confirms that the SCN population found in Sorriso is different from other isolates classified as race 4, and was called race 4(+).},

This PI line also has many desirable agronomic characteristics, which makes it an attractive source of SCN resistance for use in a soyabean breeding program. However, characterization of SCN resistance genes in this PI line have not been fully researched. In this study, we investigated the inheritance of resistance to populations of SCN races 1, 2, 3, 5, and 14 in PI 438489B. PI 438489B was crossed to the susceptible cultivar Hamilton to generate F1 hybrids. The random F2 plants and F3 lines were evaluated in the greenhouse for reaction to these five populations of SCN races. Resistance to SCN races 1, 3, and 5 were mostly conditioned by three genes (Rhg Rhg rhg). Resistance to race 2 was controlled by four genes (Rhg rhg rgh rgh). Three recessive genes were most likely involved in giving resistance to race 14. We further concluded that resistance to different populations of SCN races may share some common genes or pleiotropic effects may be involved.},

Gene reciprocity existed among them: one recessive epistasis gene pair and two dominant complementary gene pairs. Random 30 families in F3 including 10-15 tested seedlings in each family were screened for resistance to SCN race 14. The segregate ratio, 19R:38Seg.:7S, among F3 families confirmed that the presented genetic hypothesis was correct.},

	Abstract = {This project is part of work underway in our laboratories to test the hypothesis that the induction of soil suppressiveness to plant parasitic nematodes that occurs following planting of velvetbean (Mucuna deeringiana (Bort) Merr.) is associated with the development of an antagonistic microflora in soils and rhizospheres. The specific objective of this investigation was to examine long-term microbial shifts associated with the use of velvetbean in rotations to control nematodes. A crop rotation study was conducted in microplots, consisting of three crop cycles. Cycle 1 involved planting of either velvetbean or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) in the first spring. Cycle 2 during the next fall and winter was fallow or cover-cropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.). Cycle 3 the next spring was soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Populations and species diversity of bacteria and fungi in soils or rhizospheres were investigated at the end of each cropping cycle. Rhizosphere fungal populations were significantly smaller on velvetbean than on cowpea at the end of cycle 1. The use of velvetbean in cycle 1 significantly decreased rhizosphere bacterial populations on crops in cycle 2, compared to treatments which had cowpea in cycle 1. Velvetbean also influenced bacterial diversity, generally increasing frequency of bacilli, Arthrobacter spp. and Burkholderia cepacia, while reducing fluorescent pseudomonads. Some of these effects persisted through cycle 3. Fungal diversity was influenced in cycle 1 by velvetbean; however, effects generally did not persist through cycles 2 and 3. The results indicate that the use of velvetbean in a cropping system alters the microbial communities of the rhizosphere and soil, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that the resulting control of nematodes results from induction of soil suppressiveness.

@article{Urwin:2000sy,
	Abstract = {The level of resistance to the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis conferred on Arabidopsis thaliana by transgenic expression of proteinase inhibitors (PI) was studied over 40 days of infection. A cysteine PI differing from Oc-I expressed in rice seed by one amino acid (Oc-I Delta D86) had a considerable effect. It reduced parasite density and fecundity to 65 +/- 4% and 31 +/- 8% respectively, relative to values for untransformed plants when expressed at ca. 0.4% total soluble protein. The overall reproductive success was only 19 +/- 5% relative to the controls. Similar expression levels of cowpea trypsin inhibitor, a serine PI, reduced the density of the females on the plants to 77 +/- 3% of control values but did not reduce their fecundity. There was no evidence for additive effects when both PIs were expressed as a fusion protein using a peptide linker. Both PIs in the fusion PI protein are known to be functional from our previous work. When developing on A. thaliana plants expressing the transgenic proteins the intact PI fusion protein of 22 kDa was detected in nematodes by western blot analysis. Similarly, R. reniformis females were observed to have ingested Green Fluorescent Protein (28 kDa). Demonstrating the ingestion of the fusion protein, which has been associated with additive effects of the two PIs against other nematodes, supports the observation that serine PIs are of less value than cysteine PIs for R. reniformis control. The effect of Oc-I Delta D86 on R. reniformis was dependent on the level of expression of different A. thaliana lines in the range of 0.1-0.4% total soluble protein indicating that the upper level of expression is required for an effective defence. Virtual northern analysis with cysteine and serine proteinase gene probes from Heterodera glycines showed high transcript abundance of a serine proteinase in both pre-parasitic and parasitic stages whereas expression of the cysteine proteinase was more abundant in the feeding adult female. This study provides further evidence that cystatins represent a valuable source of control against a range of economic nematodes including Globodera, Heterodera and Meloidogyne and now including R. reniformis. Preliminary screening in A. thaliana provides a convenient guide for selection of transgenes against nematode pathogens of crops such as pineapple that have a prolonged regeneration period.},

Determinate and indeterminate isolines on the maturity group (MG) III cultivar Williams 82 and the MG V cultivar Essex were grown in microplots artificially infested with a race 3 isolate of H. glycines at three initial population (Pi) densities (0, 300, and 3,000 eggs/100 cm(3) soil). Soybean seed yields, nematode final population (Pf) densities and reproductive index (Pf/Pi), and root colonization by Macrophomina phaseolina, the causal agent of charcoal rots, were monitored in each year. Seed yields were reduced (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of H. glycines in both years, but losses were greater in 1996 in the absence of drought stress. Yield loss was lower (P less than or equal to 0.06) for the determinate isoline of Essex than for the other cultivar-isoline treatments across years. Nematode reproduction was density-dependent in the more conductive environment of 1996 but was unaffected by soybean maturity of determinacy traits. Root colonization by M. phaseolina increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of high H. glycines densities on determinate, but not indeterminate, isolines. Differences in H. glycines-induced yield loss among cultivar-isoline treatments were not related to nematode reproduction, M. phaseolina colonization, or environmental stresses. These results indicate that the effects of soybean maturity and determinacy of H. glycines-soybean interactions are not independent and that their combined effects must be considered in geographic regions where both traits vary.},

Foliar applications of boron (B) and B in combination with magnesium (Mg) (B+Mg) increase yield of soybean not infected with SCN by increasing pod number per plant, especially the number of pods on branches. The objective of this research was to determine if foliar applications of B and BI-Mg ameliorates the effect of SCN by increasing yield on branches. Field experiments were conducted in 1993 and 1994 in 1 m(2) microplots to compare foliar applied B and B+Mg to a control treatment. Foliar applications were made at four intervals spaced throughout soybean reproductive development of Pioneer brand 9391, an SCN susceptible cultivar. There were 12 levels of SCN Pi in 1993 and 11 levels in 1994. For each treatment, including control, grain yield was regressed on SCN Pi. Yield was reduced with increasing SCN Pi in both years, but the rate of decrease did not differ among treatments. In addition, ANOVA of yield components revealed no treatment effects on the number of branches per plant, the number of branch pods per plant, or the total number of pods per plant. Thus, foliar applications of B or B+Mg did not ameliorate the effects of SCN on soybean.},

	Abstract = {Yields of irrigated soybean in Arkansas are threatened by two problems: chloride toxicity and sudden death syndrome (SDS). Soybeans are sensitive to chloride, which accumulates in the upper soil profile when water with high salt content is used for irrigation. Sudden death syndrome is a soilborne disease often associated with well-irrigated fields. Even though these problems both affect irrigated soybeans, there are no reports on the effect of chloride toxicity on SDS. To determine if there is an effect of chloride toxicity on SDS, a test was established at the Cotton Branch Station, Marianna, AR, in 1995 and 1996. Four cultivars were selected that were either susceptible to SDS (S) or resistant to SDS (R) and either translocated chloride to the leaves (includer, I) or confined chloride in the roots (excluder, E). The cultivars were Hartz 6686 (SE), Terra Vig 6653 (SI), Hartz 6200 (RE), and Asgrow 6297 (RI). Soil chloride concentrations were adjusted by the addition of KCI. Before planting, KCI was applied to achieve the recommended concentration of K over the entire field. At V4, chloride treatments were applied by either adding no additional KCI (low Cl) or adding 1,120 kg of KCI per ha (moderate Cl) or 2,240 kg of KCl per ha (high Cl). Soil samples were taken within the center two rows of each plot at planting, flowering (R-2), and harvest and assayed for populations of Fusarium solani and Heterodera glycines. Soil chloride concentrations were determined at R-2, and leaf chloride levels were determined at R-3. Weekly disease ratings were made on SDS and converted to area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Plant lodging and the incidence of southern blight (Sclerotium rolfsii) were determined during mid-reproductive growth. Leaf chloride concentrations were influenced by both chloride treatment and cultivar: elevated concentrations occurred with the includer cultivars in the moderate and the high Cl treatments. Soil concentrations of chloride reflected the chloride treatments in 1995, but not 1996. Soil populations of E solani did not respond consistently to either chloride treatment or cultivar; however, H. glycines egg densities increased with increased soil chloride treatments in Hartz 6686 (SE) and Terra Vig 6653 (SI) at R-2, but not at harvest. Increased soil chloride treatments increased SDS in both years with Hartz 6686 (SE), but did not affect this disease in the other cultivars. Higher soil chloride treatments decreased yield in all cultivars except Hartz 6200 (RE) in 1996. Although Terra Vig 6653 (SI) did not develop severe levels of SDS foliar symptoms, it did have increased lodging and significant increases in southern blight with moderate and high soil chloride treatments. These results indicate that growers with fields that have both elevated concentrations of soil chloride and SDS should select SDS-resistant excluder cultivars to minimize yield losses due to both problems.},

Two forms of Fusarium solani pathogenic to soybean were isolated : form A, the cause of sudden death syndrome, and form B, the cause of seedling disease and root rot. Fusarium solani form B was more frequently isolated than form A. Fusarium solani form A occurred in cysts in 82% of the cyst-infested fields containing plants symptomatic of sudden death syndrome, with maximum and average isolation frequencies (across fields and years) of 28 and 7%, respectively. This fungus was not found in cysts from five fields lacking sudden death syndrome. Isolates of F. solani form B were found in high frequency in cysts from each of those fields; F. solani form B occurred in cysts in 94% of the cyst-infested fields containing sudden death syndrome, with maximum and average isolation frequencies (across years and fields) of 48 and 16%, respectively. Fusarium oxysporum (the species with the third highest average isolation frequency), F. chlamydosporum, F. equiseti, F. moniliforme, and F. pallidoroseum (syn. F. semitectum) were also isolated. Based on cyst population densities occurring in soil and percentages of cysts colonized by F. solani form A, the maximum and average numbers of colonized cysts per 500 cm(3) of rhizosphere soil were 149 and 22, respectively. Fusarium solani form A survived at a high rate in cysts in soil stored for 8 months at ca 10 degreesC, indicating an ability to overwinter in cysts between soybean growing seasons. Fusarium solani form A had a poor survival rate in cysts in soil stored for 20 months. Compared to F. solani form A, maximum and average numbers of F. solani form B in cysts per 500 cm(3) soil were higher, at 700 and 82, respectively. Furthermore, the survival rate of cysts in soil stored for 8 and 20 months was also higher. Isolates of F. solani form A from cysts were as virulent on soybean as isolates from diseased roots.},

The purpose of die study was to determine whether planting early reduces yield losses due to H, glycines. The population levels of cysts, eggs, and second-stage juveniles of H. glycines were determined from soil samples collected at planting and harvest. Yields were measured from the two middle rows of 4.9 or 6.1-m four-row plots. The population dynamics of the nematode varied with planting date, cultivar, MG, and initial nematode population. Generally, the lowest reproductive factor (Rf = final population/initial population) for any year was on the MG III cultivar, regardless of planting date or field location. Also, the Rf was generally lower on each cultivar planted in April than in June or July. The highest Rf values were on cultivars in MG VI or VII planted in June or July Yields were not consistently correlated with initial nematode population level. Early planting of late-maturing soybean cultivars may be profitable, but early planting of;MG III cultivars, though supporting little if any increase in nematode numbers, did not result in high yields.},

	Abstract = {Currently there are 16 possible races for Heterodera glycines, and these are differentiated based on ability of a nematode population to develop on a set of four differential soybean genotypes. Because results are based on numbers of nematode females that develop to a specific stage rather than on the reproductive capability of these females, race determinations based on female indices may not represent results obtained after several reproductive cycles of H. glycines. Counting numbers of eggs and juveniles, and then developing corresponding indices, would allow reproduction to be considered in making race determinations. Our objectives were to compare the present race identification scheme for H. glycines based on female indices with those using egg and juvenile indices and to examine the effect of temperature on race designations using female, egg, and juvenile indices. Race designations for H. glycines populations from mio locations in Illinois were determined at 20, 27, and 30 degreesC in a water bath. The numbers of females, eggs, and juveniles (at 19 days) were recorded, and an index based on each life stage was calculated. Race determinations based on female, egg, or juvenile indices were inconsistent when conducted at 20 degreesC, which demonstrates that this temperature is not suitable for identifying races of H, glycines. However race designations at 27 and 30 degreesC were consistent for all three indices. This indicates that counting females, eggs, or juveniles should be equally reliable when race determinations are conducted at these two temperatures, and choice of method would depend on investigator preference or research objective.},

As a result, the biological nitrogen fixation and consequently the yield of leguminous crops will be decreased due to reduced nodulation, To test this hypothesis, the in vitro interactions of a representative herbicide, paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) with Canavalis ensiformis (Con A) lectin was investigated by fluorescence and CD analysis, This model study revealed significant conformational changes In the protein structure due to extensive binding of paraquat (PQ) with Con A. The binding isotherm exhibited at least 25 PQ binding sites on Con A lectin, The Scatchard analysis suggested a binding constant and a capacity of 4.7 x 10(6) I/mole and 16.7, respectively. Thus, the agrichemicals exhibiting higher affinities for lectins may interfere with the binding of Rhizobium species to the corresponding lectins on the root surface of legumes and exert colossal Impact on the nitrogen supply and crop productivity.},

	Abstract = {Using susceptible and resistant sugar beet lines, comparative analyses of root histology and ultrastructure were made during invasion by nematodes and the induction and formation of specific feeding structures (syncytia). The resistant line carried the resistance gene Hs1(pro-1). Nematodes were able to invade and induce functional syncytia in roots of resistant and susceptible lines. However, syncytia in resistant roots were smaller and less hypertrophied. The vacuolar system of syncytia in susceptible plants contained many small vacuoles. In resistant plants vacuoles were larger but less numerous. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum prevailed in syncytial protoplasts of susceptible plants, whereas almost only rough endoplasmic reticulum occurred in syncytia in resistant plants. The most conspicuous and hitherto undescribed trait of syncytia in resistant roots was the initial appearance of loose, and later compact, aggregations of the endomembrane system which composed most of the endoplasmic-reticulum system of syncytia at later stages. Syncytia in resistant plants usually degraded before the nematodes reached their adult stage. The appearance of membrane aggregations and the other resistance-specific features are discussed in relation to their possible effects on syncytium function and role in nematode resistance.},

	Abstract = {Sequence analysis of cloned plant disease-resistance genes reveals a number of conserved domains. Researchers have used these domains to amplify analogous sequences, resistance gene analogs (RGAs), from soybean and other crops. Many of these RGAs map in close proximity to known resistance genes. While this technique is useful in identifying potential disease resistance loci, identifying the functional resistance gene from a cluster of homologs requires sequence information from outside of these conserved domains. To study RGA expression and to determine the extent of their similarity to other plant resistance genes, two soybean cDNA libraries (root and epicotyl) were screened by hybridization with RGA class-specific probes. cDNAs hybridizing to RGA probes were detected in each library. Two types of cDNAs were identified. One type was full-length and contained several disease-resistance gene (R-gene) signatures. The other type contained several deletions within these signatures.

	Abstract = {Two beta-1,4-endoglucanase (EGase) cDNAs were isolated from Globodera tabacum, the tobacco cyst nematode, and have been designated as GT-eng-1 and GT-eng-2. GT-eng-1 and GT-eng-2 encode precursor proteins with a predicted secretion signal sequence, cellulolytic catalytic domain, and a linker domain. The protein product GT-ENG-1 contains an additional 95 amino acid carboxy terminal sequence with strong similarity to type II cellulose binding domains. Riboprobes and polyclonal antibodies raised to recombinant cyst nematode EGases were used to follow expression patterns of EGase transcripts and proteins throughout the nematode life cycle. EGase transcripts and proteins were specifically detected within the subventral esophageal gland cells of G. tabacum second-stage juveniles (J2) within eggs prior to hatching, in preparasitic J2, and in parasitic J2 that had invaded tobacco roots. EGase transcripts and proteins were not detected in G. tabacum after the molt to the sedentary J3, J4, and adult female life stages. Interestingly, EGase transcription and translation resumed in the subventral esophageal glands of late J4 males. It is hypothesized that secreted EGases play a major role to facilitate intracellular migration of G. tabacum within tobacco roots.},

The cDNA, named Mi-msp-1. contained an open reading frame encoding 231 amino acids. with the first 21 amino acids being a putative secretory signal. In Southern blot analysis the Mi-msp-1 hybridised with genomic DNA from M. incognita, Meloidogyne arenaria, Meloidogyne javanica, but not Meloidogyne hapla, Heterodera glycines or Caenorhabditis elegans. In Northern blot analysis a 1 kb transcript was detected in both preparasitic and parasitic second-stage juveniles, but nor in adult females of M. incognita.

The most pronounced morphological adaptations of nematodes for plant parasitism include a hollow, protrusible stylet (feeding spear) connected to three enlarged esophageal gland cells that express products that are secreted into plant tissues through the stylet. Reverse genetic and expressed sequence tag (EST) approaches are being used to discover the parasitism genes expressed in nematode esophageal gland cells. Some genes cloned from root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst (Heterodera and Globodera spp.) nematodes have homologues reported in genomic analyses of Caenorhabditis elegans and animal-parasitic nematodes. To date, however, the candidate parasitism genes endogenous to the esophageal glands of plant nematodes (such as the beta -1,4-endoglucanases) have their greatest similarity to microbial genes, prompting speculation that genes for plant parasitism by nematodes may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.},

RAPD markers demonstrated genetic variability among and within SCN populations, and they could be used for monitoring nematode population dynamics. The OPA-07 primer was a reliable molecular marker for race 3, while electrophoretic profile analysis of DNA fragments amplified with OPA-10 primer detected slight variation within those populations identified as race 3.

Hairy roots were produced from the wounded surface of 54-95% of the cotyledon explants on MXB selective medium containing 200 mu g ml(-1) kanamycin and 500 mu g ml(-1) carbenicillin. Putative individual transformed hairy roots were identified by cucumopine analysis and were screened for transgene incorporation using polymerase chain reaction. All of the roots tested were found to be co-transformed with T-DNA from the Ri-plasmid and the transgene from the binary vectors, Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the 35S-gfp5 gene in the plant genomes, Transgene expression was also confirmed by histochemical GUS assay and Western blot analysis for the GFP. Attempts to induce shoot formation from the hairy roots failed. Infection of hairy roots of the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe)-susceptible cultivar, Williams 82, with eggs of H. glycines race 1, resulted in the development of mature cysts about 4-5 weeks after inoculation. Thus the soybean cyst nematode could complete its entire life cycle in transformed soybean hairy-root cultures expressing GFP. This system should be ideal for testing genes that might impart resistance to soybean cyst nematode.},

	Abstract = {A molecular marker was developed to separate and identify subspecific populations of Phialophora gregata, the causal agent of soybean brown stem rot. A variable DNA region in the intergenic spacer of the nuclear rDNA was identified. Two specific primers flanking the variable region were developed for easy identification of the genotypes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These two specific primers amplified three DNA products. The three PCR products were used to separate isolates of P. gregata into distinct genotypes: A (1,020 bp), B (830 bp), and C (660 bp). Genotype C was found in isolates obtained from Adzuki beans from Japan, whereas all 292 isolates obtained from soybean and the 8 isolates from mung bean belonged to either genotype A or B. The original nondefoliating (type II) strain ATCC 11073 (type culture of P. gregata) belonged to genotype B. The difference between genotypes A and B was due only to an 188-bp insertion or deletion; genotype C, however, differs from genotypes A and B at 58 point mutations, in addition to the length difference. Isolates of both genotypes A and B were widespread in seven Midwestern states. Genotype A was found mostly in certain susceptible soybean cultivars like Sturdy and Pioneer 9305, whereas genotype B was found predominately in brown stem rot-resistant soybean cvs. Bell, IA 3003, and Seiben SS282N. The specific primers were also used to directly detect cultivar-preferential infection by the two genotypes in infected soybean stems growing in the same field. Data from direct detection in soybean stems showed that cultivar-preferential infection by the two genotypes of P. gregata was significant.},

Competition for mineral elements in this sphere is high. The rhizosphere processes are driven by photosynthetically fixed carbon released by roots either directly to myconhizal fungal symbionts or as exudates fuelling a wider spectrum of organisms, mainly bacteria. In particular, the role of the soil fauna interacting with rhizosphere micro-organisms and plant roots has so far found little attention. We present evidence that the interaction between plant roots, root exudates and micro-organisms can only be understood in relation to soil faunal activity, indicating that the soil fauna has an important function in regulating rhizosphere microbial processes and therefore significantly affects plant growth.

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is one of the most important pathogens of soyabean throughout the United States. SCN decreases annual yield by four to seven percent. Management is difficult and costly as nematicides have been removed from use as environmental pollutants. With the loss of methyl bromide, only crop rotation and planting resistant varieties remain as viable management options. Breeding soybean for SCN resistance often compromises the agronomic quality. In addition SCN rapidly breaks resistance, thus it becomes important to develop new management approaches such as using molecular techniques to engineer multiple resistance into agronomically important soybean varieties. This requires understanding of the molecular genetics of resistance. To accomplish this we hypothesized that genes for SCN resistance are associated with other known resistance genes. We have used PCR with primers designed for resistance genes to fungal and bacterial pathogens from several plant species with soyabean genomic DNA as a template to test this hypothesis. Thus we looked for gene homologues in soyabean. We then used the PCR data to determine relationships to known patterns of resistance to SCN in soyabean varieties. The genes selected are known resistance genes and are thought to cluster with several resistance genes in their plant species of origin. PCR conditions were selected at a stringency to assure 75-80 percent homology between the primers and the template DNA. The PCR products were isolated and sequenced and those with DNA sequence homology of greater than 80 percent were considered to be the same gene. Sequences were then read for putative amino acid homology in the encoded protein. An 80 percent similarity was accepted as relating the two genes to the same function. From our results we have concluded that resistance to SCN involves not only specific genes encoding a resistance response to SCN, but also a coordinated expression of other resistance associated genes. We propose that these genes are necessary for the resistance response.},

The objective of this study was to bioassay 32 soyabean plant introductions (PIs) for resistance to H. glycines races 1 and 2 together with standard host differentials and a susceptible control. The bioassays were performed for each of the two races during 1997 to 1998 in thermoregulated water baths in the greenhouse. The results indicated that 25 PIs had resistance to race 1 and 24 PIs had resistance to race 2. PIs which were resistant to race 1 and either moderately resistant or moderately susceptible to race 2 included PIs 468915, 494182, 507354, 507422, and 509100.

The decomposition of organic matter results in accumulation in the soils of specific compounds that may be nematicidal. Amendments are mainly bio-products and wastes from industrial, agricultural, biological and other activities. Control of plant-parasitic nematodes can be by improvements of soil structure and fertility, alteration of the level of plant-resistance, release of nemato-toxic compounds), parasites (fungi and bacteria) and other nematode antagonistic (biological control agents). The mode of action of organic amendments leading to plant disease control and stimulation of microorganisms is complex and dependent on the nature of the amendments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	Abstract = {Information on the genetic background of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] germplasm resistant to Soybean Cyst Nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is essential for developing plant breeding strategies, however, pedigree information for SCN resistant germplasm is not always available. Using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) to fingerprint different soybean lines is a useful means of determining genetic relationships and identifying unique genotypes. In this study, 102 soybean genomic probes with five different restriction enzymes were used to detect DNA variations and investigate genetic relationships among 56 soybean plant introductions (PIs) and cultivars. Among 510 probe/enzyme combinations, a total of 1707 hybridization bands were generated, of which 501 were polymorphic. A cluster dendrogram and a principal component analysis (PCA) plot diagram were constructed using DNA fingerprinting of the 56 soybean lines. Based on the clustering and PCA analyses, two major clusters comprising 15 groups were identified for the PIs and cultivars in the dendrogram. Reactions to different race isolates of SCN were distinguishable among different groupings of the clusters and PCA results, and various origins of the PIs and the pedigree information of the cultivars could be associated with the different clusters. Additional information on the appropriate number of probes used to detect genetic diversity more efficiently was elucidated through this research. We believe that the genetic relationships determined among these 56 soybean lines could provide useful information in identifying unique sources of genes for SCN resistance.},

It is clear that DNA markers hold great promise, but realizing that promise remains elusive. Despite innovations like better marker systems and improved genetic mapping strategies, most marker associations are not sufficiently robust for successful marker-assisted selection. In large part this is due to inadequate experimental design. Molecular breeders must reassess their research programs so that DNA marker work leads to useful selection tools and valuable germplasm. As molecular breeders adopt more rigorous experimental guidelines and ambitious goals, they also need to integrate the growing body of knowledge from genomics and bioinformatics.},

The use of SCN resistant cultivars effects changes in the ability of H. glycines field populations to parasitize these cultivars. The objective of this experiment was to determine if screening for race 2 resistance alone was sufficient to identify resistance for both races 2 and 5. Progenies of crosses involving 'Hartwig" soybean were tested for resistance to either SCN race 2 or 5 in the F-2 generation and for resistance to both races in the F-2:3 generation in greenhouse studies. Individual plants were grown in soil infested with 1000 eggs of the appropriate race. Resistant plants were transplanted to the field for seed production. Progenies from the harvested plants were tested with both races in separate tests. All F-2:3 progenies resistant to race 2 were also resistant to race 5. Only 64% of F-2:3 progenies resistant to race 5 were also resistant to race 3. These results indicate that it is more efficient to screen for race 2 resistance alone than to screen for resistance to either race 5 or both races when resistance to both races is sought from crosses involving Hartwig.},

Soybean fields were randomly selected using an area-frame sampling design in collaboration with the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Soil and soybean stem samples, along with tillage information, were collected from 1,462 fields in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio. An additional 275 soil samples collected from Indiana were assessed for H. glycines. For each field, the incidence and prevalence of brown stem rot was assessed in 20 soybean stem pieces. The prevalence and recovery (expressed as the percentage of leaf disks colonized) of P. sojae and the prevalence and population densities of H. glycines were determined from the soil samples. The prevalence of brown stem rot ranged from 28% in Missouri to 73% in Illinois; 68 and 72% of the fields in Minnesota and Iowa, respectively, showed symptomatic samples. The incidence of brown stem rot was greater in conservation-till than in conventional-till fields in all states except Minnesota, which had few no-till fields. P. sojae was detected in two-thirds of the soybean fields in Ohio and Minnesota. whereas 63, 55, and 41% of the fields in Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois, respectively, were infested with the pathogen.

	Abstract = {Investigations were conducted to determine whether the effects of tillage practices on the prevalence of brown stem rot of soybean (caused by Phialophora gregata), Heterodera glycines, and Phytophthora sojae were confounded by soil texture in samples collected in the fall of 1995 and 1996. Soil and soybean stem samples, along with tillage information, were collected from 1,462 randomly selected fields in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio in collaboration with the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The incidence of brown stem rot was determined from 20 soybean stem pieces collected from each field in a zigzag pattern. The detection frequency of P. sojae (expressed as percent leaf disks colonized) and population densities of H. glycines were determined from soil cores also collected in a zigzag pattern. The soil samples were grouped into various textural classes, and the effect of soil texture and tillage relations on the activities of each pathogen were determined. Both tillage and soil texture affected the incidence of brown stem rot; however, there was no interaction between tillage and soil texture. Conservation tillage had a greater (P < 0.05) incidence of brown stem rot in clay loam and silty clay loam than did conventional tillage. The detection frequency of P. sojae was not affected by tillage, but a tillage x texture interaction (P = 0.013) indicated that the effect of tillage depended on soil texture. There was a greater (P < 0.05) detection frequency of P. sojae in conservation tillage than in conventional tillage in silt loam and loam soils. However, in sandy loam, the detection frequency of P. sojae was greater (P = 0.0099) in conventional tillage than in conservation tillage. Population densities of H. glycines were significantly affected by both tillage and soil texture, but overall, there was no tillage x texture interaction. There was an inverse relationship between population densities of H. glycines and percent clay (r = -0.81, P = 0.01) in no-till fields, but little or no change in nematode densities was observed with increasing clay content in tilled fields. Population densities of H. glycines were less (P < 0.05) in no-till fields than in tilled fields in silty clay loam and clay soils. There was no difference in H. glycines densities between the tillage categories in soils sandier than silty clay loam or clay. The findings emphasize the need for cautious interpretation of the effects of tillage practices on diseases and pathogens in the absence of information on soil texture.},

	Abstract = {Seven populations of Heterodera trifolii from Arkansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Australia plus 3 or 4 single-cyst isolates (SCI) from each population were tested for reproduction on seven species of plants to compare the host preferences among and within populations. Common lespedeza, Kummerowia striata cv. Kobe, was a good host for all populations and isolates. Therefore, a plant was considered to be a host if the number of females produced on it was 10% or more of the number on Kobe. All seven populations reproduced on Trifolium repens and T. pratense. None reproduced on Beta vulgaris or Glycine max. One single-cyst isolate from the Australian population produced a few females on T. pratense. The Australian population maintained on carnation, Dianthus caryophyllus, produced, females on carnation but not on curly dock, Rumex crispus. However, its subpopulation maintained on T. repens produced females on R. crispus but not on carnation. Four of the other six populations produced females on R. crispus, and four produced females on carnation. Differences in host range were observed among seven of the mother populations and their SCI, and among isolates within each population. Five host range patterns were found in populations and SCI of H. trifolii. Significant quantitative differences occurred among populations in the numbers of females on most hosts, between isolates and their original populations, and among isolates from the same population. SCI selected from white clover produced fewer females on a series of test hosts and had host ranges the same as or narrower than those of the original populations. However, SCI selected from Kobe lespedeza had more females on some hosts and had host ranges the same as or wider than those of the original populations. The host ranges of all populations and SCI of H. trifolii were different from those of populations and SCI of race 3 of H. glycines and H. lespedezae.},

	Abstract = {To determine the effect of different physicochemical soil parameters on plant-parasitic nematodes, organic matter, KNO3 and NaCl salts were added to sterilised sand or sandy soil. The five most frequently observed species in Senegal were inoculated on millet together or as individual species. The species were Helicotylenchus dihystera, Pratylenchus pseudopratensis, Tylenchorhynchus gladiolatus, Scutellonema cavenessi and Criconemella curvata. Shoot and root weights were measured at the end of the experiment. Organic matter had no effect on shoot growth but reduced root growth when present in a high proportion whereas KNO3 improved both shoot and root growth. Individual populations of H. dihystera increased root growth. The reproductive index of species such as S. cavenessi and C. curvata was not affected by the substrate whereas that of H. dihystera, T. gladiolatus and P. pseudopratensis was affected. The addition of KNO3 and NaCl had no influence on the reproductive index of T. gladiolatus, but reduced that of H. dihystera. These effects disappeared when nematodes were inoculated together. These experiments show that soil characteristics, as well as the soil solution influence nematode reproduction, but the response could be different if the species is present as a population or in a community. Results show that modifying the soil solution can influence nematode interactions, but this may not necessarily lead to reduction in their pathogenicity as plant susceptibility may increase in the changed environment.

Random sampling of 230 BACs indicated an average insert size of 136 kb with a range of 20 to 325 kb, and less than 4% of the clones did not contain inserts. Some 90% of BAC clones in the library have an average insert size greater than 100 kb. Based on a genome size of 1115 Mb, library coverage is 9 haploid genome equivalents. Screening the BAC library colony filters with cpDNA sequences showed that contamination of the genomic library with chloroplast clones was low (1.85%). Library screening with three genomic RFLP probes linked to soyabean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines) resistance genes resulted in an average of 18 hits per probe (range 7 to 30). Two separate pools of forward and reverse suppression subtractive cDNAs obtained from SCN-infected and uninfected roots of PI437654 were hybridized to the BAC library filters. The 488 BACs identified from positive signals were fingerprinted and analysed using FPC software (version 4.0) resulting in 85 different contigs. Contigs were grouped and analysed in three categories: (1) contigs of BAC clones which hybridized to forward subtracted cDNAs, (2) contigs of BAC clones which hybridized to reverse subtracted cDNAs, and (3) contigs of BAC clones which hybridized to both forward and reverse subtracted cDNAs. This protocol provides an estimate of the number of genomic regions involved in early resistance response to a pathogenic attack.},

Our objectives were to determine if the two ARF groups differed in their ability to parasitize juveniles, females, and eggs in the rhizosphere of soybean and to proliferate in soil. The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse using soil infested with homogenized ARF mycelium. The ARF-L isolates parasitized more juveniles and young females than did the ARF-C isolates. Suppression of these stages was 67% for ARF-L and 12% for ARF-C isolates 14 days after nematode inoculation. When soybean plants containing gravid females were transplanted into fungus-infested soil, ARF-L isolates parasitized 55 to 98% of nematode eggs, whereas ARF-C isolates parasitized 0 to 22%. In both heat-treated and nonheated soil, the biomass of mycelial mats, a measure of relative proliferation, tended to be greater for ARF-L than for ARF-C isolates. The ability of ARF-L isolates to parasitize a large percentage of both prereproductive stages and eggs of H. glycines may contribute to its effectiveness as a biological control agent.},

	Abstract = {The variation of total soluble protein extracts from white adult females of seven Meloidogyne chitwoodi and three M. fallax isolates were studied using two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). The 2-D protein profiles were compared with a computed analysis system. A synthetic image or 'master' was constructed from proteinic spots present in each isolate. The comparison of the two species allowed detection of qualitative and, to a lesser extent, quantitative variations. Among the 243 proteinic spots present on the master, we have identified 75 monomorphic spots for both species and nine discriminative proteins for each of the two species. In addition, two isoelectric point variants and two quantitative variants were observed. The similarity index and the genetic distances between the ten isolates were calculated on the basis of homologous polymorphic spots. Dendrograms were constructed according to the UPGMA method. Significance of the results from the phenetic study was assessed by bootstrap analysis. The results from the clustering analysis allowed differentiation between both species and showed intraspecific variation among the M. chitwoodi isolates equal to that among the M. fallax isolates.},

Inoculation of Rhizobium sp. prior to pathogens was more effective in reducing damage than simultaneous inoculation. Inoculation of the pathogens prior to Rhizobium sp. resulted in more damage than simultaneous inoculation. F. oxysporum and Rhizobium sp. decreased nematode multiplication.

	Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, sudden death syndrome, caused by the soilborne fungus Fusarium solani f sp. glycines, has emerged as an important production problem in the southern part of the US soybean belt. More recently, the disease has appeared in some production areas of the north-central US, and soybean producers there are concerned that it will become more prevalent in the future. Temperature, moisture, and cold stress response functions for sudden death syndrome were derived in controlled experiments and used with long-term monthly temperature and rainfall normals and regional data on soil moisture storage capacity in a generic pest risk model to determine the potential geographical range of the disease. The analysis suggests that sudden death syndrome is restricted by low moisture west of the Missouri River, and by cold stress north of 43-44 degrees latitude. It is further suggested that production areas in the heart of the north-central region, including large parts of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, are located within the range favorable for the disease. These results will be important for allocation of resources for resistance breeding and disease management research. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is an important soilborne disease of soybean caused by the fungus Fusarium solani. This disease is also associated with the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines. To quantify the vertical and temporal distribution of these pathogens in the soil profile, a study was conducted at the University of Arkansas Pine Tree (PTS) and Cotton Branch Stations (CBS) in 1991. Soil samples were taken at six depths (0 to 7, 7 to 15, 15 to 30, 30 to 50, 50 to 75 and 75 to 100 cm) at four growth stages (planting, R2, R6 and harvest) and numbers of F. solani, SCN and total fungi were determined. Soil physical and chemical characteristics were measured at planting and soybean root densities were measured at R2 and R6. Disease development was followed weekly in August and September. Soil numbers of F. solani were greatest in the top 15 cm of soil throughout the season. SCN egg numbers also were greatest in this zone until harvest. At harvest, numbers significantly increased at depths of at least 50 cm. The greatest root densities were in the 0- to Ij-cm zone. At both locations, the 0- to 15-cm zone was over a plow pan under which the pH decreased from 6.4 to 7.0 above the pan to 3.8 to 4.5 below the pan. Total fungal numbers were greatest in the upper soil layers at planting but declined until there were no significant differences in numbers of total fungi with depth from R2 to harvest. SDS developed sooner and was more severe at PTS than at CBS. PTS had greater numbers of F. solani but supported lower numbers of SCN at the end of the season than CBS. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Molecular markers associated with loci conferring SCN resistance would be useful in breeding programs using marker-assisted selection (MAS). In this study, 200 F-2:3 families derived from two contrasting parents, SCN-resistant 'Peking' with relatively low protein and oil concentrations, and SCN-susceptible 'Essex' with high protein and oil concentrations, were used to determine loci underlying the SCN resistance and seed composition. Three different SCN Race isolates (1, 3, and 5) were used to screen both parents and Fz,, families. The parents were surveyed with 216 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes with five different restriction enzymes. Fifty-six were polymorphic and contrasted with trait data from bioassays to identify molecular markers associated with loci controlling resistance to SCN and seed composition. Five RFLP markers, A593 and T005 on linkage group (LG) B, A018 on LG E, and K014 and B072 on LG H, were significantly linked to resistance loci for Race 1 isolate, which jointly explained 57.7% of the total phenotypic variation. Three markers (B072 and K014, both on LG H; T005 on LG B) were associated with resistance to the Race 3 isolate and jointly explained 21.4% of the total phenotypic variation. Two markers (K011 on LG I, A963 on LG E) associated with resistance to the Race 5 isolate together explained 14.0% of the total phenotypic variation. In the same population we also identified two RFLP markers (B072 on LG H, B148 on LG F) associated with loci conferring protein concentration, which jointly explained 32.3% of the total phenotypic variation. Marker B072 was also linked to loci controlling the concentration of seed oil, which explained 21% of the total phenotypic variation. Clustering among quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conditioning resistance to different SCN Race isolates and seed protein and oil concentrations may exist in this population. We believe that markers located near these QTLs could be used to select for new SCN resistance and higher levels of seed protein and oil concentrations in breeding improved soybean cultivars.},

Separate assays were developed for two nematodes: root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). For egg hatch to be successfully assayed, eggs must first be surface-disinfested to avoid the confounding effects of incidental microbial growth facilitated by the fungal culture medium. Sodium hypochlorite was more effective than chlorhexidine diacetate or formaldehyde solutions at surface-disinfesting soybean cyst nematode eggs from greenhouse cultures. Subsequent rinsing with sodium thiosulfate to remove residual chlorine from disinfested eggs did not improve either soybean cyst nematode hatch or juvenile mobility. Soybean cyst nematode hatch in all culture media was lower than in water. Sodium hypochlorite was also used to surface-disinfest root-knot nematode eggs. In contrast to soybean cyst nematode hatch, root-knot nematode hatch was higher in potato dextrose broth medium than in water. Broth of the Fungus Fusarium equiseti inhibited root-knot nematode egg hatch and was investigated in more detail. Broth extract and its chemical fractions not only inhibited egg hatch but also immobilized second-stage juveniles that did hatch, confirming that the fungus secretes nematode-antagonistic metabolites.},

However, expression of SCN resistance in hairy soyabean roots has not been investigated. A transgenic hairy root system would be useful in developing an assay for candidate SCN resistance genes. The objectives of this study were to characterize transgene expression in SCN-infected hairy soyabean roots and to evaluate a transgenic hairy root system for investigations of resistance to SCN. Seedling cotyledons of the SCN-susceptible cultivars Agassiz and Parker, and SCN-resistant Bell and Faribault, were infected with A. rhizogenes strain K599 transformed with T-DNA binary vectors containing the gusA gene fused to promoters from either the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV 35S), Arabidopsis thaliana phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) or bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) chalcone synthase-8 (CHS) [naringenin-chalcone synthase] genes. Nine days after inoculating transgenic hairy roots with sterile J2 nematodes, CHS-regulated beta -glucuronidase (GUS) staining at infection sites increased in hairy roots of resistant Faribault and decreased in susceptible Agassiz. PAL-regulated GUS staining was absent at infection sites in hairy roots of resistant cultivars, but was increased in infection sites in susceptible cultivars. Thirty-five days after inoculation with SCN, the mean number of cysts formed on hairy roots of the resistant cultivars was about 14% of the mean number of cysts formed on hairy roots of the susceptible cultivars, indicating that the SCN resistance phenotypes were preserved in transgenic hairy roots. These results indicated that the transgenic hairy soyabean root system will be useful for investigating differential transgene expression during nematode infection and evaluation of candidate SCN resistance genes.},

Our objectives were to verify that co-inheritance was derived from a single chromosomal region in near-isogenic lines and to separate component gene clusters. DNA markers were compared with a SDS leaf-scorch index (DX), F. solani root-infection severity (IS) and a SCN index of parasitism (IP) among 80 near-isogenic lines (NILs). The genomic region identified by the RFLP marker Bng122D was strongly associated (0.0004 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 0.006) with mean SDS DX (R-2 > 16-38%) and IS (R-2 > 38-73%), but only marginally associated with resistance to SCN, However, the linked (4.3-7.4 cM) microsatellite marker SATT309 was strongly associated with both resistance to SCN (0.0001 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 0.0003; R-2 > 24-97%) and mean leaf DX (0.0001 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 0.0003; R-2 > 25-63%), but not root IS. Recombination events among markers and traits enabled separation of the qualitative loci underlying resistance to SDS and SCN. Our data showed that resistance to SDS DX, SDS IS and SCN IP in Forrest may be caused by four genes in a cluster with two pairs in close linkage or by a two-gene cluster with each gene displaying pleiotropy, one conditioning SDS IS and DX and the other SCN LP and SDS DX.},

The results showed that resistance to the cyst nematode in this soybean population is of a qualitative nature and conditioned by three genes, one dominant and two recessives. The heritability of the character was very high (0.96), with minimum environmental effect, which means that this population is suitable for the development of soybean cultivars resistant to the cyst nematode.},

FMRFamide-related peptides were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific activities were remarkably similar among all of the vermiform members of the three species. FMRFamide-related peptide immunoactivity was present in both sexes and all stages of H. glycines examined. The highest specific activity was present in second-stage juveniles and in males, and the lowest in white and yellow females. Total FMRFamide-related peptide level per individual was highest in brown females, with 90% of the activity associated with the eggs. Peptide levels in these eggs and in second-stage juveniles were comparable and increased in adults, especially in females. Chromatographic analysis of FMRFamide-related peptide preparations from H. glycines juveniles, C. elegans, and P. redivivus revealed distinct qualitative differences between the infective plant parasite and the free-living nematodes.},

The polypeptides were present in equal amounts in, and were most abundant in, eggs from yellow females. They were also present in brown females but were not detected in second-stage juveniles (J2). The two major egg polypeptides, MEP-I and MEP-II, accounted for more than 50% of the total protein in egg extracts evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. During development of females from the yellow stage to the brown stage, the levels of MEF-I and MEP-II declined at twice the rate as total protein.

Polygalacturonases (PGs) are a class of cell-wall-modifying enzymes with precise temporal and organ-specific expression, A 350-bp fragment with high homology to PGs was identified by differential display (DD) analysis of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) race 3 resistant PI 437654 and susceptible cultivar Essex, The fragment was strongly expressed in Essex, 2 days after inoculation (DAI). Complete coding sequences of two PG cDNAs, PGI and PG2, were isolated by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (RACE PCR), PI 437654 and Essex had identical PGI and PG2 sequences. A transversion from A to C created a PstI restriction site in the PG2 cDNA that was used to distinguish the two PG cDNAs by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) analysis. A cDNA encoding a polygalacturonase-inhibitor protein (PGIP) that is 89% identical to the Phaseolus vulgaris PGIP was isolated from soybean roots by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, Steady-state levels of PG and PGIP were investigated by RNA gel blot analysis in roots 1 to 5 DAI and in hypocotyls and leaves. Differences in the constitutive levels of PG mRNAs were observed in roots of different soybean genotypes, Steady-state levels of PG mRNAs were enhanced during compatible interactions with SCN and reduced in incompatible interactions and in mechanically wounded roots. Enhanced PGIP transcription was observed in response to mechanical wounding in both PI 437654 and Essex, but only in compatible interactions with SCN, suggesting uncoupling of PGIP functions in developmental and stress cues. Constitutive expression in incompatible interactions shows PGIP is not a factor in SCN resistance. Thus, the up-regulation of endogenous PG transcription in soybean roots early after SCN infection could facilitate successful parasitism by SCN.},

	Abstract = {Current control of plant parasitic nematodes often relies on highly toxic and environmentally harmful nematicides. As their use becomes increasingly restricted there is an urgent need to develop crop varieties with resistance to nematodes. The limitations surrounding conventional plant breeding ensure there isa clear opportunity for transgenic resistance to lessen current dependence on chemical control. The increasing use of molecular biology techniques in the field of plant nematology is now providing useful information for the design of novel defences to meet the new needs. Plant responses to parasitism are being investigated at the molecular level and nematode gene products that could be targets for a direct anti-nematode defence are being characterized. The potential of an anti-feedant approach to nematode control has been demonstrated. It is based on the transgenic expression of proteinase inhibitors. The rational development of this strategy involves characterization of nematode proteinase genes and optimization of inhibitors by protein engineering. Durability of the resistance can be enhanced by stacking transgenes directed at different nematode targets.},

Males were attracted to females, and mating was observed. Mating was required for reproduction. Fertilized females began to lay eggs 19 DAI and continued egg laying without the further presence of males during a 90-day observation. All of the eggs hatched. Unfertilized females rarely laid eggs, and none of the eggs were able to hatch. Feeding took place between each molt and before egg deposition occurred.

	Abstract = {Changes in microbial communities associated with nematode control were studied by comparing population numbers of fungi and bacteria in the soil and in internal root tissues (endorhiza) in non-amended and chitin-amended soils. Addition of chitin to soil at 1% (w/w) eliminated plant-parasitic nematodes in a first planting of cotton cv. 'Rowden' and significantly reduced Meloidogyne incognita infestation in a second planting, confirming long-term nematode suppressiveness induced by this organic amendment. The chitin amendment was associated with an increase in fungal and bacterial populations, especially those with chitinolytic activity. The bacterial communities of soil, rhizosphere and endorhiza were assessed by examining the taxonomic diversity of recoverable bacteria based on identification with fatty acid analysis of sample sizes of 35 soil and rhizosphere bacteria and 25 endophytic bacteria. All major bacterial species which formed at least 2% of the total population in non-amended soils and rhizospheres also occurred with chitin amendment. In contrast, chitin-amended soils and rhizospheres yielded several species which were not found without chitin amendment, including Aureobacterium testaceum, Corynebacterium aquaticum and Rathayibacter tritici. Burkholderia cepacia was recovered from both amended and non-amended soils and rhizospheres, but it was most abundant with chitin amendment at the end of the first cotton planting. Soil was probably the major source for bacterial endophytes of cotton roots, since nearly all endophytic bacteria were also found in the soil or rhizosphere. However, two dominant genera in the soil and rhizosphere, Bacillus and Arthrobacter, were not detected as endophytes. Chitin amendment exhibited a further specific influence on the endophytic bacterial community; Phyllobacterium rubiacearum was not a common endophyte following chitin amendment, even though chitin amendment stimulated its populations in non-planted soil. Burkholderia cepacia, found in similar numbers in the soil of both treatments, was the dominant endophyte in plants grown in chitin-amended soil but rarely colonized cotton roots grown in non-amended soil. These results indicate that application of an organic amendment can lead to modifications of the bacterial communities of the soil, rhizosphere and endorhiza. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Geostatistical methods were used to describe and map the distribution of H. glycines over 4 years in a soybean (Glycine max) field in southeastern Missouri. Semivariograms and kriging, an interpolation method, were used to prepare isoarithmic contour maps and associated error maps. In the field studied, fall H. glycines population density (Pf) was poorly related to density the following spring (Pi). The distribution of peak H. glycines population density within the field changed from year to year, although high densities were often detected in the same general region of the field. The patchiness of H, glycines distribution within a field was verified, Yield was not related to H. glycines egg population density at planting, indicating that unmeasured variables were also reducing yield.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that an important factor relating the dynamics of microbial communities and nutrient flux in grassland soils is a change in nondetrital inputs, such as root exudates, associated with below-ground herbivory. Our objective was to quantify the effects of different amounts of root infestation, and hence herbivory, by clover cyst nematodes (Heterodera trifolii) on the biomass and structure of rhizosphere microbial communities of white clover (Trifolium repens) plants grown in a grassland soil of low nutrient status. An additional aim was to test the hypothesis that these biotic interactions are influenced by soil texture, in particular a prevalence of soil pores of less than 30 mu m dia. We found that at day 89, low amounts of root herbivory by H. trifolii, below the damage threshold for white clover, resulted in significant increases in total microbial biomass, measured by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and the abundance of gram-positive and gram-negative specific PLFAs in the rhizosphere soil. At this time there were also significant increases in the abundance of fatty acids synthesized by fungi and actinomycetes in the rhizosphere of infested clover plants. However, an increase of root herbivory above the damage threshold for clover, had no, or a negative effect on soil microbial biomass and individual PLFAs. The positive effects of root herbivory on rhizosphere microorganisms at day 89 were thought to correspond with an infestation by a second generation of nematodes. The results suggest that changes in the biomass of microorganisms in the rhizosphere of lightly-infested plants were not accompanied by changes in the structure of the microbial community as the fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratio was unaffected by the herbivory treatment. Soil texture had no effect on the ability of clover cyst nematodes to infest clover roots. There was also no soil type x nematode interaction, suggesting that the effects of root herbivory on the rhizosphere microbial community were similar in both soils. However, microbial biomass and the abundance of several individual PLFAs were higher in the clay loam than the sandy loam soil. The significance of these results in terms of nutrient flows in sustainable grassland systems is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We examined the expression of these EGases in the subventral glands of all post-embryonic life stages of H. glycines by in situ hybridization and immunolocalization. The first detectable accumulation of EGase mRNAs occurred in the subventral glands of unhatched J2. EGase transcripts remained detectable in J2 after hatching and during subsequent root invasion. However, in late parasitic J2 and third-stage juveniles (J3), the percentage of individuals that showed EGase transcripts decreased. In female fourth-stage juveniles and adult females, EGase transcripts were no longer detected in the subventral glands. EGase hybridization signal reappeared in unhatched males coiled within the J3 cuticle, and transcripts were also present in the subventral glands of migratory adult males. Immunofluorescence labeling showed that EGase translation products are most abundantly present in the subventral glands of preparasitic J2, migratory parasitic J2, and adult males. The presence of EGases predominantly in the migratory stages suggests that the enzymes are used by the nematodes to soften the walls of root cells during penetration and intracellular migration.},

	Abstract = {Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are versatile DNA markers that are readily assayed and highly informative. Unfortunately, non-targeted approaches to SSR development often leave large genomic regions without SSR markers. In some cases these same genomic regions are already populated by other types of DNA markers, especially restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). To identify SSR markers in such regions, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones can be used as intermediaries. First, one or more BAC clones in a region of interest are identified through the use of an existing DNA marker. BAC clones uncovered in this initial step are then used to create a small insert DNA library that can be screened for the presence of SSR-containing clones. Because BAC inserts are often 100-kb pairs or more in size, most contain one or more SSRs. This strategy was applied to two regions of the soyabean genome near genes that condition resistance to the soyabean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) on molecular linkage groups G and A2. Two soyabean cultivars, Faribault and Williams 82, were used as sources of DNA for the construction of BAC libraries. Several additional cultivars and one plant introduction were used to create two mapping populations for the map placement of SSR and other DNA markers: one population of 240 F7-derived inbreds from Minsoy x Noir 1 and the other from Evans x PI209332. SSR polymorphism was characterized in the following cultivars: Clark, Harosoy, Jackson, Williams, Amsoy, Archer, Fiskeby V, Minsoy, Noir 1 and Tokyo. A genetic linkage map was constructed using two new SSR loci (BARC-Satt038 and BARC-Satt309) in the regions near the soyabean cyst nematode resistance gene rhg1. This targeted approach to identifying new DNA markers can readily be extended to other types of DNA markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Inchinoe) is the most economically significant soybean pest. The principal strategy to reduce or eliminate damage from this pest is the use of resistant cultivars. Identifying resistant segregants in a breeding program is a difficult and expensive process which is complicated by the oligogenic nature of the resistance and genetic variability in the pathogen. Fortunately, resistance at one SCN-resistance locus, rhg1, is generally accepted as a necessity for the development of resistant genotypes using any source of resistance and when challenged by any SCN race. Thus, the development of SCN resistant cultivars would be expedited if an effective and rapid system were available to identify breeding lines carrying a resistance allele at the rhg1 locus. In this study we report two simple sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite loci that cosegregate and map 0.4 cM from rhg1. Allelic variation at the first of these loci, BARC-Satt309, distinguished most, if not all, SCN-susceptible genotypes from those carrying resistance at rhg1 derived from the important SCN-resistance sources 'Peking', PI 437654, and PI 90763. BARC-Satt309 was also effective in distinguishing SCN resistance sources PI 88788 and PI 209332 from many, but not all, susceptible genotypes. BARC-Satt309 cannot be used in marker-assisted selection in populations developed from typical southern US cultivars crossed with the important resistance sources PI 88788 or PI 209332 because these genotypes all carry the identical allele at the BARC-Satt309 locus. A second SSR locus, BARC-Sat168, was developed from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone that was identified using the primers to BARC-Satt309. BARC-Sat168 distinguished PI 88788 and PI 209332 from southern US cultivars such as 'Lee', 'Bragg' and 'Essex'. Both BARC-Satt309 and BARC-Sat168 were used to assay lines from SCN-susceptibleXSCN-resistant crosses and proved to be highly effective in identifying lines carrying rhg1 resistance from those carrying the allele for SCN susceptibility at the rhg1 locus.},

	Abstract = {A number of molecular genetic maps of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] have been developed over the past 10 yr. These maps are primarily based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. Parental surveys have shown that most RFLP loci have only two known alleles. However, because the soybean is an ancient polyploid, RFLP probes typically hybridize and map to more than one position in the genome. Thus, the polymorphic potential of an RFLP probe is primarily a function of the frequency of the two alleles at each locus the probe detects. In contrast, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are single locus markers with multiple alleles. The polymorphic potential of an SSR marker is dependent on the number of alleles and their frequencies. Single locus markers provide an unambiguous means of defining linkage group homology across mapping populations. The objective of the work reported here was to develop and map a large set of SSR markers. A total of 606 SSR loci were mapped in one or more of three populations: the USDA/Iowa State G. max x G. soja F2 population, the Univ. of Utah Minsoy x Noir 1 recombinant inbred population, and the Univ. of Nebraska Clark x Harosoy F2 population. Each SSR mapped to a single locus in the genome, with a map order that was essentially identical in all three populations. Many SSR loci were segregating in two or all three populations. Thus, it was relatively simple to align the 20+ linkage groups derived from each of the three populations into a consensus set of 20 homologous linkage groups presumed to correspond to the 20 pairs of soybean chromosomes. On the basis of in situ segregation or linkage reports in the literature all but one of the classical linkage groups can now be assigned to a corresponding molecular linkage group.},

	Abstract = {The effect of crop sequence on parasitism of second-stage juveniles (J2) of Heterodera glycines by Hirsutella rhossiliensis was investigated. Data were collected from plots of a long-term crop rotation experiment established in 1982. Crop sequences included (i) continuous monoculture of corn and soybean; (ii) annual rotation of the two crops; and (iii) 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years of each crop following 5 years of the other crop. The nematode J2 density and percentage of J2 parasitized by the fungus were determined at planting, midseason, and end of season in 1997 and 1998. A significant effect of the crop sequence on parasitism of J2 was observed at midseason in both years and at end of season in 1998. In plots of first-year soybean following 5 years of corn, fungal parasitism increased from an undetectable level at planting to 2% and 4% of J2 parasitized by ends of season in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Fungal parasitism was similar in plots of second-through-fifth-year soybean after 5 years of corn and in plots of soybean monoculture. Parasitism of J2 in the soybean plots in annual rotation with corn increased from undetectable and 2% at planting to 6% and 23% at midseason in 1997 and 1998, respectively The effect of crop sequence on the fungal parasitism of J2 may be attributed to a density-dependent relationship between the parasite and its host. Season also affected the fungal parasitism; percentage of J2 parasitized by the fungus was the highest at midseason and the lowest at planting.},

Not only will scientists be poring over data mined from this resource, but techniques and methodologies developed along the way have changed the way we can approach biological questions. The completion of the C. elegans genomic sequence will be of particular importance to scientists working on parasitic nematodes. In many cases, these nematode species present intractable challenges to those interested in their biology and genetics. The data already compared from parasites to the C. elegans database reveals a wealth of opportunities for parasite biologists. It is likely that many of the same genes will be present in parasites and that these genes will have similar functions. Additional information regarding differences between free-living and parasitic species will provide insight into the evolution and nature of parasitism. Finally, genetic and genomic approaches to the study of parasitic nematodes now have a clearly marked path to follow.},

	Abstract = {Chronological events of the interaction between the hyphomycete Verticillium lecanii and the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae were investigated by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The parasitism of M. euphorbiae by V. lecanii appears to involve the following events: (i) adherence of conidia to the host cuticle through a thin mucilagenous matrix; (ii) germination of the conidia and production of mycelium that colonizes the surface of the cuticle; (iii) penetration of germ tubes into the aphid cuticle 24 h after application of the pathogen; (iv) extensive lateral development of hyphae accompanied by pronounced degradation of the cuticular layers by 72 h. Labeling with the WGA/ovomucoid-gold complex showed that penetration and colonization of the cuticle by the fungus resulted from localized enzymatic hydrolysis, likely through the synergistic action of chitinases and mechanical pressure; (v) production of blastospores and massive invasion of aphid internal tissues; (vi) assimilation of nutrients and accumulation of lipids by fungal cells; and (vii) production of conidiophores and release of the fungus from aphid cadavers. These observations bring further insights into the mechanisms by which V; lecanii parasitizes M. euphorbiae. They also provide a basis for comparing the modes of action of V. lecanii against hosts from fungal and animal origins. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

The RAPD patterns of the inbred populations had a lower number of total bands and a lower percentage of polymorphic bands among individual cysts than the initial population. The estimated number of polymorphic loci detected by RAPD analysis was about 25% for the initial population and 4% to 7% fur the inbred lines. Reproduction of H. glycines decreased for 6 of 24 inbred-soybean combinations. In particular, reproduction of three inbred populations on PI 90763 was greatly reduced.

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines is an economically important pest of soybean in the United States. The steps necessary to manage this nematode are to sample for inoculum density, identify the race present, and then select appropriate control measures. Planting resistant cultivars is the most widely used management practice, and this tactic has provided enormous economic benefits. However, the nematode has adapted to each source of resistance deployed. The time required for the nematode to adapt to resistant cultivars is lengthened by including nonhost crops and susceptible cultivars in rotations with resistant cultivars. Searching for new sources of resistance and developing more techniques to prolong the effectiveness of resistance genes are necessary to maintain profitability for soybean producers.},

	Abstract = {Several soybean (Glycine max) cropping sequences were planted for 12 years in a field that, at the beginning of the test, was infested with race 14 of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Continuous soybean cropping sequences included H. glycines-susceptible cultivars Forrest, J82-21, Peking x Centennial breeding line, and moderately resistant cultivars Bedford and J81-116. Forrest treated with aldicarb or pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) plus metalaxyl and resistant breeding line JS83-236 followed by resistant cultivars Cordell and Hartwig were additional continuous soybean sequences. Rotations included two sequences each of Bedford with J81-116 or J82-21, and three sequences of Bedford with corn (Zea mays) and susceptible Essex soybean. Rotations of Bedford, corn, and Essex had 12-year mean yields significantly greater than continuous Bedford or Forrest. The female index (FI) of H. glycines on five cultivars and lines was used to bioassay changes in parasitic potential in each cropping sequence. The Fl on Bedford bioassay plants increased significantly over time for all field treatments involving Bedford. When J82-21 was the bioassay plant, FI decreased significantly in treatments involving Bedford. There were no significant changes in FI for any treatment when Forrest, J81-16, and Peking were used as bioassays. Rotations of soybean cultivars with different sources of resistance and rotations of resistant and susceptible cultivars with a nonhost crop were not successful practices to manage the nematode's ability to parasitize the resistant cultivar Bedford. However, rotation of resistant and susceptible cultivars with a nonhost crop produced greater mean soybean yields and slowed the shift toward greater parasitism of the resistant cultivar sufficiently to warrant adoption of this practice.},

HG-eng1 and GR-eng1 both contained eight introns and structural domains of 2151 and 2492 bp, respectively. HG-eng2 and GR-eng2 both contained seven introns and structural domains of 2324 and 2388 bp, respectively. No significant similarity in intron sequence or size was observed between HG-eng1 and HG-eng2, whereas the opposite was true between GR-engl and GR-eng2. Intron positions among all four cyst nematode cellulase genes were conserved identically in relation to the predicted amino acid sequence. HG-eng1, GR-eng1, and GR-eng2 had several introns demarcated by 5'-GC...AG-3' in the splice sites, and all four nematode cellulase genes had the polyadenylation and cleavage signal sequence 5'-GAUAAA-3'-both rare occurences in eukaryotic genes. The 5'-flanking regions of each nematode cellulase gene, however, had signature sequences typical of eukaryotic promoter regions, including a TATA box, bHLH-type binding sites, and putative silencer, repressor, and enhancer elements. Database searches and subsequent phylogenetic comparison of the catalytic domain of the nematode cellulases placed the nematode genes in one group, with Family 5, subfamily 2, glycosyl hydrolases from Scotobacteria and Bacilliaceae as the most homologous groups. The overall amino acid sequence identity among the four nematode cellulases was from 71 to 83%, and the amino acid sequence identity to bacterial Family 5 cellulases ranged from 33 to 44%. The eukaryotic organization of the four cyst nematode cellulases suggests that they share a common ancestor, and their strong homology to prokaryotic glycosyl hydrolases may be indicative of an ancient horizontal gene transfer.

We studied the effects of rotation with bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum), velvetbean (Mucuna pruiens), or continuous soybean, aldicarb, and soybean cultivar on yield and population densities in two fields infested with a mixture of Meloidogyne spp. and H. glycines. Velvetbean and bahiagrass reduced population levels of both nematode species to near zero prior to planting soybean. At harvest, both nematode populations were equal in soybean following bahiagrass and continuous soybean but were lower following velvetbean. Both bahiagrass and velvetbean as previous crops were equal in producing significantly (P < 0.003) higher yield than continuous soybean. Velvetbean increased subsequent soybean yield by 98% and bahiagrass increased subsequent soybean yield by 85% as previous crops compared to continuous soybean. The major differences between the two rotation crops were yield response of the nematode-susceptible cultivars and at-harvest nematode populations. Velvetbean tended to mask genetic differences among cultivars more so than bahiagrass. Velvetbean also produced a more long-term effect on nematode populations, with numbers of both Meloidogyne spp. and H. glycines lower in soybean following velvethean than following bahiagrass or continuous soybean.},

Virus-specific fluorescent signals were observed in the virus-retention region of 44% of the nematode fragments examined. The percentage of nematodes labeled with virus-specific fluorescence increased as the acquisition access period increased from 0 to 22 days; the increase paralleled the increase in the transmission efficiency of the nematode population.

Race 5 was identified as race 15 at the 100 infestation density in one test, and as race 1 at the 1,000 density in another test. Race 6 had significant numbers of females on Peking and P190763 that resulted in female indices of 34 on Peking and 14 on P190763 when the infestation density was 10,000. Race 14 was consistently identified between infestation densities of 4,000 and 10,000 but was identified as race 6 or 9 at the 100 infestation density and as race 4 or 14 at the 1,000 infestation density. Race 1 was identified as race 5 in a few instances because Pickett was not resistant to this population. The results of this series of experiments suggest that an infestation density of 4,000 eggs and second-stage juveniles/pot is best for race identification. Races were very poorly differentiated at the lowest density, differentiation was inconsistent at the 1,000 infestation density, and densities higher than 4,000 had reduced numbers of females on Lee 74 and relatively high numbers on the differentials which resulted in poor race differentiation with some races.},

	Abstract = {An unnamed fungus, designated ARF, that parasitizes eggs and sedentary stages of cyst nematodes is a potential biological control agent of Heterodera glycines. The objectives of this study were to determine whether XRF isolates differ in their ability to suppress nematode numbers in soil and to compare the efficacy of ARF in heat-treated and native soil. The effectiveness of 11 ARF isolates,vas compared by introducing homogenized mycelium into heat-treated soil. Soybean seedlings were transplanted into pots containing fungus-infested soil and inoculated with H. glycines. After 30 or 60 days, the number of nematodes and the percentage of parasitized eggs were determined. Three isolates (907, 908, and TN14), which were previously reported to be weak egg parasites in vitro, consistently suppressed nematode numbers by 90% to 100%. Of the isolates previously reported to be aggressive egg parasites, four (903, BG2, MS3, and TN12) reduced nematode numbers by 56%, to 69%, in at least one experimental trial, but the other four had no effect on nematode numbers. When the efficacy of isolate TN14 was tested in heat-treated and native soil, nematode suppression was greater in the heat-treated soil in only one of two trials. In both soil treatments, nematode numbers were reduced by more than 60%. We conclude that virulence toward nematode eggs in vitro is a poor indicator of effectiveness of an ARF isolate in soil, and that the presence of soil microbes may reduce, but does not completely inhibit, activity of isolate TN14.},

	Abstract = {Electron and light microscopy were used to study the dorsal gland (DG) and the two subventral glands (SvG) of seven developmental phases of Nacobbus aberrans: pre-parasitic second-stage juveniles (J2), parasitic J2, third- (J3) and fourth- (J4) stages, migratory females, young sedentary females, and mature sedentary females. In each developmental phase the level of esophageal gland activity was estimated by the abundance of organelles associated with secretory pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi, multivesicular bodies, and secretory granules. All esophageal glands were metabolically active in all J2 examined, although only in parasitic J2 were there numerous secretory granules in the esophageal gland extensions and ampullae. No evidence of secretory activity was observed in the esophageal glands of the coiled and relatively inactive J3 and J4, nor in migratory females; these stages apparently do not feed. Observations suggest that reserves stored by J2 sustain three ecdyses and the migratory female's search for a feeding site and induction of a syncytium. Feeding activity is resumed in young and mature sedentary females, in which the DG is highly active and enlarged. The SvG are metabolic ally active, but with little synthesis of secretory granules, suggesting that in sedentary females the SvG may have physiological roles other than digestion.},

	Abstract = {beta-1,4-Endoglucanases (EGases, EC 3.2.1.4) degrade polysaccharides possessing beta-1,4-glucan backbones such as cellulose and xyloglucan and have been found among extremely variegated taxonomic groups. Although many animal species depend on cellulose as their main energy source, most omnivores and herbivores are unable to produce EGases endogenously. So fan all previously identified EGase genes involved in the digestive system of animals originate from symbiotic microorganisms. Here we report on the synthesis of EGases in the esophageal glands of the cyst nematodes Globodera rostochiensis and Heterodera glycines. From each of the nematode species, two cDNAs were characterized and hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed that the four catalytic domains belong to family 5 of the glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3), These domains show 37-44% overall amino acid identity with EGases from the bacteria Erwinia chrysanthemi, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Bacillus subtilis. One EGase with a bacterial type of cellulose-binding domain was identified for each nematode species. The leucine-rich hydrophobic core of the signal peptide and the presence of a polyadenylated 3' end precluded the EGases from being of bacterial origin. Cyst nematodes are obligatory plant parasites and the identified EGases presumably facilitate the intracellular migration through plant roots by partial cell wall degradation.},

Our objective here is to report the production, identification, and breeding behavior of monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) each with 2n = 40 chromosomes of soybean and one chromosome from G. tomentella Hayata (accession PI 483218, 2n = 78). Glycine tomentella contains genes controlling several economically useful traits such as resistance to soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi Sydow) and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) and tolerance to salt and drought. We have isolated 287 plants with 2n = 41 chromosomes from PC, and BC4 progenies. On the basis of distinguishing morphological features, these fines were grouped into 22 MAALs and were designated as MT-I to MT-XXII. MT denotes max and tomentella. The addition of an extra chromosome of G. tomentella to the 2n soybean complement modified several morphological traits including flowering habit, plant height, degree of pubescence, seed fertility, number of seed per pod and plant, pod and seed color, and seed yield. The female transmission of an extra G. tomentella chromosome in MAALs averaged 36.5% and male transmission averaged 11.7%. This study sets a stage whereby the germplasm treasure harbored in exotic germplasm, the wild perennial relatives of the soybean, which was unexplored and not utilizable in the past, can now be reached by geneticists and plant breeders.},

Combination of clay and sand of 3:1 gave best plant growth response followed by combination of 4:0 and 2:2 of clay:sand. Use of G. mosseae or P. fluorescens in different soil types caused significant increase in plant growth except in plants grown in pure sand. Use of G. mosseae or P. fluorescens both in uninoculated and nematode inoculated plants caused almost similar increase in plant growth but the combined use of both organisms caused greater increase in plant growth than when used singly. Plants grown in purr sand had the least galling and nematode reproduction. Moreover, plants grown in a mixture of clay and sand of 1:3 supported highest falling and nematode reproduction, followed by 2:2 and 3:1 clay:sand ratio. Applications of G. mosseae or P. fluorescens caused reduction in falling, nematode reproduction and morphometric parameters of females. Combined use of both organisms caused higher reduction in galling, nematode reproduction and morphometrics than their individual application. All the parameters of morphometrics observed showed reduction in their size except stylet length and styler knob width. AM colonization was best in plant roots grown in 3:1 clay:sand ratio and least when grown in pure sand. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome, caused by Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, has increased in prevalence in soybean production regions in the North-Central United States. Little is known about soil factors and environmental conditions that influence disease severity in this pathosystem We studied associations between biological, chemical, and physical soil variables and severity of foliar symptoms of sudden death syndrome in nine commercial soybean fields in Iowa during 1995 and 1996. Disease was patchy in all fields, and soil samples were collected in each field along a transect that ran from a symptomless area through a diseased area. There were 25 sampling stops along each transect, separated by distances of 1.5 to 2.5 m. At each stop, soil samples were collected and soil strength, soil moisture, and foliar disease severity (at plant growth stage R6) were measured. Soil samples were assayed for population densities of F. solani f. sp. glycines, cysts of the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines), and for chemical variables (soluble salts, pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Fe). Cross-correlation analyses were carried out to test for associations between soil variables and disease severity in individual fields, while discriminant analysis was used to assess the effects of soil variables across all fields. Disease severity showed consistent associations with E solani f. sp. glycines populations (strong effect) and H. glycines cyst counts (minor effect). Available K was identified as a possible disease-enhancing factor, but the magnitude of its effect was dependent on the overall K-concentrations in the fields. For example, as the median K-concentration increased, the correlation between K and disease decreased. None of the other soil variables showed consistent associations with disease. The results suggest that localized presence or absence of E solani f. sp. glycines is the chief reason for the patchiness of sudden death syndrome in affected fields. Thus, manipulation of soil nutrient status or fertility level appears to have limited potential for reducing disease in the high-yield soybean production environment of Iowa. Instead, producers should focus on preventing the establishment or reducing populations of F. solani f. sp. glycines and H. glycines in their fields.},

All of the wild perennial Glycine species were resistant (Female Indices [FI] less than 10) to all of the isolates that were tested on them. In most cases no females matured. The soybean cvs. Clark 63 and Altona, which were tested at the same time as the hybrids, were susceptible to all isolates of H. glycines tested. When the tests were combined and a single FI calculated with the average number of females on Lee 74, one derived fertile line was resistant to race 3, three derived fertile lines were resistant to race 5, and five derived fertile lines were resistant to race 14.

To determine the relationship between SDS and yield components, 16 F-6-derived lines from the cross 'Pyramid' x 'Douglas' were tested in two southern Illinois locations (Cora and Ridgway) with natural infestation by the SDS pathogen. Plots were rated for disease incidence (DI), disease severity (DS), and reproductive development stage (R). DI and DS were standardized to R6. Disease index (DX) was calculated as DI x DS/9. Individual plant data collected on three plants per plot were DS, total flowers, total pods at R5.5 (mid-pod-fill) and R8, total empty and partially filled pods at R8, total seeds, seeds per pod, seed weight per plant, and 100-seed weight. Seed quality was rated only at Ridgway. The among genotypes (genetic) covariance and the within genotype (environmental) covariance detected significant reductions in yield per unit of DS and DX (whole plot data). The genetic covariance with individual plant IDS detected a significant reduction per unit of DS in total seed weight per plant. The environmental covariance with DS detected significant reductions in all yield components except flowers, empty pods, and seed per pod. There was a significant correlation of G x E effects of most yield components and DS. Generally, genetic and environmental covariances were similar in magnitude and direction, suggesting that test genotypes were similar in the components affected and the degree of yield loss associated with a given level of disease.},

	Abstract = {Colonization of sot bean roots by the biocontrol fungus Verticillium lecanii was studied in vitro and in situ. For in vitro experiments, V. lecanii was applied to soybean root tip explant cultures. Four weeks after inoculation, the fungus grew externally on at least half of the roots (all treatments combined), colonizing 31% to 71% of root length (treatment means). However, when a potato dextrose agar plug was available as a nutrient source for the fungus, root tips inoculated soon after transfer were trot colonized by V. lecanii unless Heterodera glycines was present. Scanning electron microscopy of colonized roots from in vitro cultures revealed a close fungus-root association, including fungal penetration of root cells in some specimens. In the greenhouse, soybeans in sandy soil and in loamy sand soil were treated with V. lecanii applied in alginate prills. The fungus was detected at greater depths From the sandy soil than from the loamy sand soil treatment, but fungus population numbers were small and variable in both soils. Root box studies coupled with image processing analysis of the spatial distribution of V. lecanii in sand) soil supported these findings. Verticillium lecanii was detected randomly in the rhizosphere and soil of root boxes, and was rarely extensively distributed. These in vitro and in situ experiments indicate that V. lecanii can grow in association with soybean roots but is a poor colonizer of soybean rhizosphere in the soil environment.},

Each pot contained 600 g loamy sand to which either 1,000 or 5,000 Meloidogyne incognita eggs were added. Five strains of the fungus Verticillium lecanii were individually applied in root drenches to the tomato plants at the time of transplanting, at an application rate of about 0.08% (dry weight fungus/dry weight loamy sand). The strains were a wild type strain and four mutants induced from that strain. Control plants were treated with water only or with autoclaved (nonviable) fungus. The experiments ended 45 days after transplanting, when the number of eggs per pot, root infection ratings, root lengths, and shoot dry weights were determined. The numbers of eggs counted from fungus-treated plants did not differ significantly from the numbers on water-only control plants. Application of autoclaved wild type strain to pots treated with 5,000 eggs resulted in an infection rating significantly higher than infection ratings recorded from several other fungus treatments and from plants treated with water only, but not in increased egg numbers.},

Forty days after inoculation, numbers of all three nematodes, except H. glycines on Bryan, generally increased with increasing inoculum levels in Experiment I. Heterodera glycines and M, incognita significantly decreased growth only of Tracy M. At 45 and 57 days after inoculation with 6,000 individuals/pot in experiments II and III, respectively, significantly more P. penetrans and M. incognita than H, glycines were found on Bryan. However, H. glycines and M. incognita population densities were greater than P. penetrans on G88-20092 and Tracy M. Growth of Tracy M infected by H, glycines and M, incognita and growth of G88-20092 infected by M. incognita decreased in Experiment III. Pratylenchus penetrans did not affect plant growth.

	Abstract = {The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) clone pBLT65 is a 450-nt soybean cDNA encoding a portion of the bifunctional enzyme aspartukinase-homoserine dehydrogenase (AK-HSDH). pBLT65 maps within 3.5 cM of the i locus, conferring a pigmented seed coat, on linkage group A, hence, it is closely linked to the Rhg(4) locus conferring resistance to race 3 of the soybean cyst nematode. From this useful RFLP we developed a PCR reaction yielding polymorphic bands for use in marker-assisted breeding programs to select progeny containing the Rhg(4) allele. The polymorphic bands were sequenced to determine the cause of the polymorphisms. Using primers 548 and 563, PCR amplification of DNA from the soybean cultivar Peking (Rhg(4)) yielded three DNA fragments, la (1160 bp), Ib (1146 bp) and 3 (996 bp). Amplification of DNA from the cultivar Kent (rhg(4)) yielded DNA fragments 2 (1020 bp), 3 (996 bp) and 4 (960 bp). Fragments la, Ib, 2 and 4 were also polymorphic between the soybean lines PI 290136 and BARC-2(Rj(4)). A segregating population of 80 F-2 and F-3 plants derived from the cross PI 290136 x BARC-2 (Rj(4)) was used to confirm the map position of the PCR polymorphisms near the i locus, and hence the Rhg(4) locus on linkage group A. The nucleotide sequences of fragments Ib, 3 and 4 were determined. Large and small deletions in the intronic region were responsible for the size differences of the different fragments, whereas the exon was well conserved.},

Effect of inoculum age (0-7 days after eggs were released from cysts) and inoculation site (meristem, elongation, or differentiation zone) on infection were tested on four soybean genotypes. Two genotypes (PI 437654 and cv. Peking) were resistant and two (cv. Essex and cv. Hutcheson) were susceptible to race 3 of H. glycines. Inoculum consisting of second-stage juveniles (J2) was prepared by gently agitating nematode eggs at 75 revolutions per minute at 28 degrees C for various intervals. Infection rates were monitored cytologically. The most consistent infection rate was obtained with 48-hour-old inoculum containing more than 80% J2. More than 100 juveniles/root were observed after inoculation with the 48-hour-old inoculum placed at the root elongation zone, in both resistant and susceptible soybeans. Horizontal orientation of roots during inoculation, the use of concentrated J2 inoculum (500 J2 in 125 mu l/root), and restriction of inoculum to the root elongation zone facilitated synchronous root infection.},

	Abstract = {The plant parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines is amphimictic: populations consist of both male and female individuals that reproduce sexually. However, under conditions of environmental stress, unbalanced male and female sex ratios are found. This observation requires an explanation of how sexual fate is determined in these nematodes. As a step towards identifying genes that are differentially regulated between male and female nematodes we have used cDNA differential display to screen for male-specific cDNA sequences. These studies have led to the isolation of a full-length male specific cDNA, Hgm1, that is up regulated in H. glycines males. Sequence analysis of this cDNA reveals that it represents a novel gene which encodes a 49.5 kDa acidic protein with a pi of 4.72 and a predicted 21 amino acid leader sequence. Neither the nucleotide nor the predicted amino acid sequence of this gene show any homology to sequences in the databases suggesting that Hgm1 is a previously uncharacterised gene.

However, no additive effect of adjuvant-herbicide combinations was observed, nor did herbicide rate affect SCN reproduction. Treatments reduced SCN reproduction only when applied to soybeans and had no effect on SCN reproduction when applied directly to the soil. No treatment stimulated SCN reproduction relative to the untreated control. Soybeans treated with COG, NIS, acifluorfen, and bentazon also had more glyceollin detected than the untreated control.

	Abstract = {Field experiments conducted from 1989 to 1991 focused on potential interactions of insects and weeds, as influenced by a low rate of aldicarb (0.84 kg a.i./ha in-furrow application) in the presence of Heterodera glycines (SCN). A split-split-plot experimental design was used with whole plots as aldicarb treatments, sub plots designed to manage weed densities and sub-sub plots to manage insects. The sites were planted without pre-emergence herbicides, and post-emergence herbicides were utilized to maintain weed densities as desired. Numbers of SCN females per 3-plant-root systems were less in aldicarb-treated plots in 1989 and 1991, but not in 1990. Aldicarb treatment resulted in increased plant height, canopy width, and number of nodes per soybean plant. The increased canopy growth tended to result in lower weed and lower corn earworm population densities in aldicarb-treated plots. Numbers of corn earworm larvae were greater (P = 0.05) in untreated plots in 1989 and 1991. Weed densities were significantly greater (P = 0.05) in plots not treated with aldicarb in 1991. Treatment with aldicarb resulted in increases of 100-200 kg/ha soybean seed yield, averaged over 3 years. The data indicate that control of soybean cyst nematode can reduce insect- and weed-pest pressure on soybean, but the net return was economically justifiable in only one out of three years in these experiments.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the interrelationships of Heterodera glycines races based on their resistance to soybean (Glycine max) cultivars and lines against which they were tested. Greenhouse tests determined the numbers of females of each of eight races of H. glycines that developed on 277 to 522 soybean cultivars and lines. A Female Index (number of females on a test cultivar as a percentage of the number on 'Lee 74') was calculated and used in frequency distributions, correlations, and duster analyses of the resistance reactions to the different races in an attempt to determine relationships among cultivars. Frequency distribution patterns of all cultivars and lines tested against each race were skewed in favor of resistance, and in some cases bimodality was observed. The majority of correlations between pairs of races were highly significant. Cluster analyses based on the correlations divided eight races into four clusters that explained 73% of the variation in resistance. Cluster 1 was comprised of races 2, 4, and 14; Cluster 2 was comprised of races 6 and 9; Cluster 3 was comprised of races 1 and 3; and Cluster 4 was comprised of race 5.

	Abstract = {Seventy-six populations of Heterodera glycines were collected from 33 counties in 10 states of the United States along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in 1992 and 1993. A sterile hyphomycete fungus of an unnamed taxon, designated ARF18 and shown to be a parasite of eggs of H. glycines, was isolated from eggs and cysts of 10 of the populations from Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Ten isolates of ARF18 obtained in this study and seven isolates obtained in earlier studies were characterized for cultural morphology on several growth media, the ability to produce sclerotium-like structures (SLS) on cornmeal agar, growth rates, pathogenicity to eggs of H. glycines in vitro, and mitochondrial (mt) DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). All 17 isolates of ARF18 readily grew on potato dextrose agar, cornmeal agar, and nutrient agar. Based on colony morphology and SLS appearance on corn-meal agar, the isolates could be grouped into two morphological phenotypes. Isolates that produced SLS that were composed of a compact mass of hyphae were designated ARF18-C, whereas isolates that produced SLS composed of a mass of loosely clumped hyphae were designated ARF18-L. Only minor differences in growth rates were detected among the ARF18-C and ARF18-L isolates. Ail 10 ARF18-C isolates, which were from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee, belonged to a single mtDNA RFLP haplotype. The seven ARF18-L isolates shared many comigrating mtDNA restriction fragments with one another, but belonged to three distinct mtDNA RFLP haplotypes. Ability to infect eggs of H. glycines in vitro varied considerably among the various isolates of ARF18. In particular, several of the ARF18-C isolates were consistently able to infect over 50% (mean = 70.0%, standard deviation = 16%) of the eggs of H. glycines, whereas ARF18-L infected eggs to a lesser degree (mean = 25%, standard deviation = 27%). ARF18-C was isolated only from H. glycines populations from below 37 degrees N latitude. The presence of ARF18 was associated with soils with Mg levels 4.5 per 100 cm(3), and iron levels >203.5 kg/ha; or with Mg levels >314 kg/ha and Na levels <121 kg/ha. The widespread distribution of ARF18 and the ability of some isolates to aggressively colonize eggs of H. glycines are indications that it has potential as a biological control agent for H. glycines.},

Merr,] rotation and on populations of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) (SCN), The research was conducted on a Loring silt loam soil (a fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Fragiudalf), using no-tillage management. The experimental design was a split-plot for corn evaluation and split-split-plot for soybean evaluation, Individual treatments were replicated five times, Main plots were broadcast P-K rates of 0-0, 15-28, 29-56, 44-84, and 59-112 kg ha(-1). The split-plots were continuous corn, continuous soybean, a corn-soybean rotation, and a soybean-corn rotation, The split-split-plots were two soybean cultivars possessing different levels of SCN resistance, Yields of both crops were increased by the fertilization, In this study, corn yields were increased 14% and soybean yields increased 11% with the rotation. Rotating the two cultivars produced similar yields and nonrotated yields of resistant TN 4-86 were higher than susceptible Essex, indicating an effect of SCN, The primary benefit of corn in the rotation was to reduce SCN populations. However, within Essex rotations the SCN population recovery was rapid, while populations remained relatively low in the TN 4-86 rotations, The SCN populations were greater when rotations were fertilized with the two lowest P-K rates, compared with populations within the unfertilized check and the highest P-K rate. Soybean producers should consider a no-tillage system of rotating corn with SCN-resistant soybean cultivars, fertilized at high P and K rates for yield improvement and reduced SCN populations.},

	Abstract = {Changes in the diameter of the nucleolus of the dorsal pharyngeal gland (DPGN) in unhatched second-stage juveniles (J2) of potato cyst nematodes, Globodera spp., were monitored for cysts recovered during two field experiments in the Bolivian Central Andes. In the first experiment, cysts were extracted from soil left fallow or supporting crops of potato, barley, lupin, or quinoa. The highest mean DPGN diameter for unhatched J2 occurred shortly after planting in January. The values were similar for individuals recovered from cysts associated with all cultivations. For cysts from potato plots, the lowest mean DPGN diameter of 2.26 +/- 0.05 mu m occurred in March, but the value increased again by May to 2.53 +/- 0.05 mu m. Similar seasonal changes were found for J2 under both nonhost crops and fallow with the smallest diameters recorded in May of 2.48 +/- 0.05 mu m and 2.34 +/- 0.05 mu m, respectively. Two possible factors might cause this significant seasonal change. First, some J2 may hatch early in the growing season, even in the absence of the host. This would enhance the proportion of dormant, unhatched J2 remaining in the cyst samples. Secondly, a seasonal change in the DPGN diameter may occur for most individuals with a transient fall value between January and March/May. A model defined by this study provides a good description of the observed effect, providing both factors are assumed to occur. The second experiment studied if changes in size of DPGN in response to a hatching stimulus are influenced by the cyst population age. The DPGN in unhatched J2 was measured for cysts recovered from soils that had supported potatoes that growing season or 2 or 4 pears earlier. The unhatched J2 from the freshly cropped potato site showed the largest mean DPGN diameter of 3.66 +/- 0.05 mu m after 7 days in potato root diffusate, whereas those from the 4-year sample had the smallest value of 3.20 +/- 0.05 mu m. This significant difference may indicate a delayed response to the hatching stimulus with more prolonged J2 dormancy.},

We used differential display of mRNA to detect host gene expression changes during the early compatible interaction between soybean and H, glycines, Fifteen cDNA clones corresponding to mRNAs with different abundances in N, glycines-infected versus uninfected roots were identified. Differential display results indicated that abundances of five mRNAs increased in infected roots, whereas abundances of 10 mRNAs decreased. Transcripts for nine of these 15 cDNAs could be detected on RNA blots, and their hybridization signals confirmed the differential display results for eight of these nine cDNAs, Sequence analyses identified five cDNAs with decreased mRNA levels in infected roots as corresponding to two putative aldolase genes, a transcription-factor TFIIA homologue, the soybean small GTP-binding protein gene sra1, and the soybean auxin down-regulated gene ADR12. RNA blot analyses of other auxin down-regulated genes revealed a decrease in their mRNA abundances in H, glycines-infected roots as well.},

For the early nodulin gene enod2, the parents of RILs, Minsoy and Noir1, showed a polymorphism (5.5 vs 5.9 kb) after EcoRV digestion. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of 42 RILs were analyzed with the MAPMAKER program, linking enod2 to the seed coat color gene, I, with a distance of 11.1 cM on linkage group U3 of RIL map. enod2 and I are located close to Rhg4, a soybean cyst nematode resistance gene, and a locus for seed coat hardness. The molecular marker pA-110 and seed coat color were used to integrate enod2 on an F2 segregating population (72 plants) generated from a cross between cv. Bragg and G. soja PI468.397. enod2 was mapped in the same order as on the RIL map but 18.5 cM from the I locus on the TN map.

	Abstract = {Research during the past 30 years has revealed the main economically important nematode species in Cuba, and identified serious nematode pests that warrant quarantine exclusion from the country. Nematodes appear to cause few problems in sugarcane, the foremost crop in Cuba. Meloidogyne arenaria, M. javanica and especially M. incognita race 2 are responsible for yield reduction in tobacco as high as 27% when the crop is grown on sandy soil. Various species of root-knot nematode also damage coffee, guava, soybean, and various field and vegetable crops. Loss of citrus yield to T. semipenetrans averages 9-11% in older orchards with high population densities. Pratylenchus coffeae is the dominant pathogen among other commonly encountered members of the genus such as P. brachyurus, and P. pratensis. P. coffeae damages coffeae, banana and plantain in the eastern provinces, and P. zeae is sometimes a problem on rice grown in non-flooded conditions. Radopholus similis is also a serious pest of banana, primarily in the western provinces. The incidence of Rotylenchulus reniformis has increased in recent years, and its status as a pest in numerous crops is under evaluation. Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst), Radinaphelenchus cocophilus Meloidogyne spp. capable of parasitizing citrus, and the citrus race of R. similis have not been detected in Cuba. Nematicides are not widely used to manage nematodes in Cuban crops, with the exception of tobacco and guava. Management is primarily by means of host-crop resistance/tolerance, sanitation, and various cultural practices. Use of biological control organisms is practiced to some extent. Most notably, Paecilomyces lilacinus is used in some nurseries and at planting to help manage R. similis on banana.},

	Abstract = {In February 1997, during a current evaluation of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in Brazil, a field population collected at Sorriso county - State of Mate Grosso - was identified in the greenhouse as race 4. This race was also found to infect soybean cv. Hartwig which had been until that time, resistant in all tests even with race 4. The present work aimed to confirm the race of the nematode, to investigate its multiplication in the cv. Hartwig and other breeding lines, and to compare the capacity of infection of Sorriso population with that one of another population from Chapad (a) over tilde o do Ceu. It was found that nematode population from Sorriso, identified as race 4, could infect 'Hartwig' and also three breeding lines from the cross 'Hartwig'(4) X BR92-3 1830 with the same reaction. The genotype PI 437654 remained resistant in all tests. The two nematode populatios proved to be different in relation to parasitism in soybean cv. Hartwig. This is the first report of SCN population collected in the field infecting 'Hartwig'. It is suggested that 'Hartwig' be added to the four differential genotypes used for race identification in Brazil and that this specific population of Sorriso be called race 4(+) (four-plus).},

Formaldehyde-fixed J2 were cut into sections with a vibrating razor blade to make the inside of the nematodes accessible for probing. These nematode fragments then were hybridized in suspension with riboprobe, and labeled with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody to digoxigenin. Staining with nitroblue tetrazolium and bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate revealed a highly specific hybridization signal to mRNA within the cytoplasm of the subventral gland cells, using this specific antisense probe. This insitu hybridization protocol will be useful for the characterization and identification of esophageal gland secretion genes in plant-parasitic nematodes, among other applications.},

Lines from the soybean breeding program in Missouri that had 'Hartwig' soybean as a parent were the most resistant to races 1-4 of the soybean cyst nematode and the population of reniform nematode evaluated here. Numerous cysts of an inbred soybean cyst nematode race 4 population were produced on several of these Hartwig descendants, however, and accession $92-1603 had a cyst index of 29.2%. These accessions were also susceptible to M. arenaria and M. arenaria.

Soybean germplasm from the Georgia breeding program demonstrated the strongest resistance to the root-knot nematode species tested.

However, distinguishing parasitism genes from those merely required for nematode viability remains a substantial challenge. Although this will ultimately require a functional test in the host or parasite, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can be exploited as a heterologous system to determine function of candidate parasitism genes. Studies of C. elegans also have revealed genetic networks, such as the dauer pathway, that may also be important adaptations for parasitism. As a more directed means of identifying parasitism traits, we developed classical genetics for Heterodera glycines and have used this approach to map genes conferring host resistance-breaking phenotypes. It is likely that the C. elegans and H. glycines genomes will be at least partially syntenic, thus permitting predictive physical mapping of H. glycines genes of interest.},

	Abstract = {Early researchers identified key concepts and developed tactics for multiple-option management of nematodes. Although the emphasis on integrated pest management over the past three decades has promoted strategies and tactics for nematode management, comprehensive studies on the related soil biology- ecology are relatively recent. Traditional management tactics include host resistance (where available), cultural tactics such as rotation with nonhosts, sanitation and avoidance, and destruction of residual crop roots, and the judicious use of nematicides. There have been advances in biological control of nematodes, but field-scale exploitation of this tactic remains to be realized. New technologies and resources are currently becoming central to the development of sustainable systems for nematode-pest-crop management: molecular diagnostics for nematode identification, genetic engineering for host resistance, and the elucidation and application of soil biology for general integrated cropping systems. The latter strategy includes the use of nematode-pest antagonistic cover crops, animal wastes, and limited tillage practices that favor growth promoting rhizobacteria, earthworms, predatory mites, and other beneficial organisms while suppressing parasitic nematodes and other plant pathogens. Certain rhizobacteria may induce systemic host resistance to nematodes and, in some instances, to foliage pathogens. The systems focusing on soil biology hold great promise for sustainable crop-nematode management, but only a few research programs are currently involved in this labor-intensive endeavor.},

	Abstract = {A two-year soil sampling study was conducted on four microplots naturally infested with Heterodera glycines and an undescribed species of Pasteuria. The objectives of the study were to investigate the population dynamics of both organisms and to assess the potential of Pasteuria sp. as a biological control agent of H. glycines. Seasonal fluctuations were observed in numbers of cysts, eggs per cyst, second-stage juveniles (J2) of H. glycines, number of Pasteuria endospores attached per J2, and percentages of endospore-encumbered J2. Percentages of endospore-encumbered J2, Y, increased with the mean numbers of endospores per J2, X, according to the equation Y = 87.0(1 -e(-0.53x)). In contrast, numbers of J2 per 250 cm(3) soil, Y, decreased with the numbers of endospores per J2, X, according to the exponential decay model Y = 67.4 + 220.1e(-1.2x) The equilibrium J2 density (67.4 +/- 3.3) derived from this function was consistent with the predictions of the Lotka-Volterra model of population dynamics based on the equation 0.0195ln(y) - 0.000336y = 0.000049x - 0.00285ln(x) + 0.06589, where x and y represent the biweekly means of J2 densities and the percentages of endospore-encumbered J2, respectively. In all cases, predicted equilibrium densities of J2 were below the damage threshold reported from field studies. These results indicate that, given sufficient time following introduction into a field, Pasteuria may increase to levels that would be effective as one component in an integrated pest management program to control X. glycines.},

Our objective was to test the efficiency of an alternative method for screening soybean genotypes for resistance to H. glycines in field plots. The alternative method was compared to the standard method of sowing the test genotypes in fields found to be infested during the previous crop season. In the alternative method, the test genotypes are sown in the furrow following the uprooting of 45-day-old infected plants. The alternative method resulted in twice the cyst population and fewer escapes, and more consistent results than the standard method. The major advantage of the alternative method is that it permits screening in a more homogeneous distribution of H. glycines in the soil.},

An east-to-west decreasing trend of SDS prevalence was found at the state level. No SDS was found in the western part of Iowa. The disease was found in commercial production fields in 4 Iowa crop reporting districts - central, north-central, east-central, and southeastern - with the greatest severity and the most frequent occurrence of SDS found in the east-central district. In two counties along the Mississippi River, disease prevalence was high; more than 50% of soybean fields had SDS in locations where surveys were conducted. Intensive surveys on a local scale were conducted in areas around the fields where the disease was first noticed. In areas where disease prevalence was low, all detected infested fields belonged to the same owners. In areas where disease prevalence was high, no such pattern was found. Disease incidence varied from field to field. Information on SDS occurrence at different geographic scales serves as baseline information to monitor the future development of the disease in Iowa.},

Total yield losses caused by Heterodera glycines in these 10 countries were greater than those caused by any other disease. Next in order of importance were stem canker, brown spot, and charcoal rot. The total yield loss due to disease during 1994 in these countries was 14.99 million metric tons, valued at $3.31 billion. Methods used to estimate soybean disease losses were field surveys, plant disease diagnostic clinic samples, variety trial data, information from field workers and university extension staff, research plots, grower demonstrations, and private crop consultant reports. Yield loss estimates due to a particular disease varied by country. For example, yield losses due to rust were reported from China and Indonesia, but no losses due to this disease were reported from any of the remaining eight countries.

A two-year study was initiated to determine grain yield and nematode population increase on soybean cyst nematode-resistant cultivars in maturity groups II and III in production fields. Sites differed in soil texture, nematode densities, and P. sojae infestation at a number of locations in Ohio. Soil was assayed for nematode densities before planting and at harvest. Yields of resistant cultivars averaged 0% to 18% higher than those of susceptible cultivars in fine-textured soils with average preplant populations ranging from 463 to 14,330 SCN eggs/100 cm(3) soil. In coarse-textured soils, yields of susceptible cultivars were 21% to 56% less than the resistant cultivars with average preplant densities ranging from 1,661 to 15,558 SCN eggs/100 cm(3) soil. The reproductive index ranged from 0.1 to 5.5 for resistant cultivars and 0.4 to 112 for susceptible cultivars. In 1993, yield of P. sojae-susceptible, nematode-resistant 'Asgrow A 3431' was as high as yield of the P. sojae-resistant, nematode-susceptible cultivar 'Resnik' in a Phytophthora-infested field. The nematode-resistant cultivars Madison Experimental 131527 and Asgrow A3431 had higher yields than AgVenture AV1341 and susceptible cultivars Resnik and Kenwood when compared over five nematode-infested sites. Nematode-resistant cultivars were found to be excellent alternatives to currently grown susceptible cultivars for managing SCN where group III cultivars are used. However, better cultivar alternatives may be needed for sites with combined Phytophthora root rot and cyst nematode problems.},

	Abstract = {Two cDNAs encoding cysteine proteinases were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from feeding females of Heterodera glycines. The library was screened with a cysteine proteinase gene fragment originally amplified from cDNA of H. glycines. Database searches predict that 1 cDNA (hgcp-I) encodes a cathepsin L-like proteinase, while the second (hgcp-II) encodes a cathepsin S-like enzyme. Both predicted proteins contain a short secretion signal sequence, a long propeptide and a mature protein of 219 amino acids. Southern blot analysis suggests that the cathepsin S-like enzyme, HGCP-II, is encoded by a single-copy gene in contrast to the cathepsin L-like proteinase, HGCP-I which may have 2 homologues. The regions encoding the mature proteinases were cloned into an expression vector and recombinant protein produced in E. coli. HGCP-I was shown, after refolding, to cleave the synthetic peptide Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, and this activity could be inhibited by the engineered rice cystatin Oc-I Delta D86. HGCP-II showed no activity against the synthetic substrates tested. The knowledge gained from these studies will improve our understanding of plant nematode proteinases and aid the development of a rational proteinase inhibitor-based approach to plant nematode resistance.},

Laboratory research was conducted to compare hatching of H. glycines eggs from external egg masses with that of eggs extracted from within females and cysts (encysted eggs). Egg-mass eggs were collected by soaking infected soybean roots in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, and encysted eggs were collected from females and cysts dislodged from the same roots with a stream of water. Eggs were incubated at 25 degrees C in deionized water, 9.0 mM ZnSO4 solution, or one of three synthetic H. glycines hatch inhibitors, and hatched juveniles were counted every other day for 22 days. Samples of eggs collected at the beginning and end of all experiments were analyzed to determine extent of embryo development. Egg-mass eggs hatched more rapidly than encysted eggs during the first 16 days, but not thereafter. Throughout the experiments, hatch of egg-mass eggs in deionized water was greater than that of encysted eggs. From dq 8 to day 22, egg-mass eggs were less sensitive than encysted eggs to the hatch inhibitor 2-(2'-carboxyethyl)-5-[carboxy(hydroxy)methylidenyl]cyclopentanone. A greater proportion of egg-mass eggs contained vermiform juveniles than did encysted eggs at the beginning of the experiments, but not at the end. Results indicated that H. glycines egg-mass and encysted eggs have different hatching behaviors that cannot be explained entirely by differences in embryological development.},

European, Asian, and North American isolates of five heteroderid species were examined to assess intraspecific variation. PCR-RFLP patterns of amplified ITS1 DNA from pea cyst nematode, Heterodera goettingiana, from Northern Ireland were identical with patterns from Washington State. Sequencing demonstrated that ITS1 heterogeneity existed within individuals and between isolates, but did not result in different restriction patterns. Three Indian and two U.S. isolates of the corn cyst nematode, Heterodera zeae, were compared. Sequencing detected variation among ITS1 clones from the same individual, between individuals, and between isolates. PCR-RFLP detected several restriction site differences between Indian and U.S. isolates. The basis for the restriction site differences between isolates from India and the U.S. appeared to be the result of additional? variant ITS1 regions amplified from the U.S. isolates, which were not found in the three India isolates. PCR-RFLP from individuals of the U.S. isolates created a composite pattern derived from several ITS1 types. A second primer set was specifically designed to permit discrimination between soybean (H. glycines) and sugar beet (H. schachtii) cyst nematodes. Fok I digestion of amplified product from soybean cyst nematode isolates displayed a uniform pattern, readily discernible from the pattern of sugar beet and clover cyst nematode (H. trifolii).},

Based on seed yields and the levels of lower stem and taproot colonization by M. phaseolina, four cultivars-Asgrow 4715, DeltaPineland 3478, Hamilton, and Jackson II-were rated moderately resistant to M. phaseolina. Seed yields and M. phaseolina levels in host tissues were affected by planting date, relative maturity class, H. glycines response, and the environmental conditions that prevailed over the 3 years of the study. However, in general, the environmental, agronomic, and host genetic factors present in these experiments did not affect the individual cultivar/pathogen interaction.

All of these subventral gland proteins (svp's) focused in the basic range (pI 6.8 to 8.6) of an immobilized pH gradient. Western blotting showed that the svp's were present in preparasitic and parasitic J(2), and not in later juvenile stages and adult females. Minor svp quantities also were observed in adult males. Immunogold labeling of preparasitic J(2) showed that the svp's were localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory granules of the subventral esophageal glands. Potato root diffusate triggered the secretion of svp's through the stylet, and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine-hydrogen-oxalate had only a quantitative, additional effect. The forward flow of svp's through the metacorporal pump chamber was confirmed by the presence of svp's in the circular lumen of the esophagus (procorpus), as established by immunoelectron microscopy. Our data provide conclusive evidence that secretory proteins of the subventral glands of G. rostochiensis can be secreted through the stylet and support the hypothesis that the subventral esophageal glands play an important role in the early events of this nematode-plant interaction.},

In 1989 all plots were planted to a soybean cultivar susceptible to both pathogens (cv. Lee 74). In 1990 and 1991, the plots were planted to one of the following crops: soybean cv. Lee 74, soybean cv. Hartz 6130 (resistant to both pathogens), sorghum, fescue, or wheat (not double-cropped). In 1992 all plots were planted to soybean cv. Lee 74. The parameters measured to determine rotation effects were severity of SDS over the season, the soil population densities of both pathogens, soybean yields and soybean seed weights. Rotation to any crop except soybean significantly reduced the H. glycines population densities in 1990 and 1991. In 1991, the H. glycines population densities began to rise in the nematode-resistant soybean treatment, but were lower than those in the susceptible soybean treatment. Averaged over all years, the F. solani population densities were significantly lower when sorghum or wheat were grown than when soybean or fescue were grown. Considering the whole season, the F. solani population densities were generally the highest at harvest. Negative correlations between SDS and yield were significant, as were positive correlations between SDS and population densities of F. solani. In 1992, SDS was very low in all treatments, but yields were highest in plots planted to non-soybean crops and lowest in plots planted to the susceptible soybean. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Production of macroconidia by the causal agent of sudden death syndrome, Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, occurred on lower stems and roots of soybean plants symptomatic for the disease in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Most of the sporulation was light to dark blue to blue-green in color. Microscopically (15x) visible sporulation occurred on plants in 26, and macroscopically visible sporulation occurred on plants in 15, of 32 fields inspected. In some fields, the incidence of plants with microscopically visible sporulation was as high as 70%, and the incidence of plants with macroscopically visible sporulation reached 50%. Sporulation varied from pinpoint microscopic areas to macroscopically visible masses 4 to 6 cm(2) or larger. Areas of microscopically visible sporulation occurred on lower stems and roots within 2.5 cm above and below the soil line on about 50% of the plants, and areas of macroscopically visible sporulation occurred within the same region on about 60% of the plants. Both microscopic and macroscopic sporulation also occurred on taproots as far as 10 cm or more below the soil line. Severe foliar symptoms and root decay were associated with a greater incidence of plants with sporulation. The occurrence of sporulation should help distinguish sudden death syndrome from other diseases of like foliar symptomatology and help confirm its diagnosis. It is presumed from the results that sporulation eventually contributes to the inoculum density of F. solani f. sp. glycines in soybean fields.},

	Abstract = {Two morphological forms of Fusarium solani pathogenic on soybean, forms A and B, were further characterized and distinguished from other fungi. Questions regarding their identity were addressed Soybean plants grown in the field and in a growth chamber were inoculated with Fusarium solani form A and F. solani f. sp. phaseoli. F. solani form A incited leaf symptoms typical of sudden death syndrome; F. solani f. sp. phaseoli did not. It was concluded that the two fungi are different and distinguishable on the basis of host specialization and the types of symptoms they incite on soybean. F. solani form A, the causal agent of sudden death syndrome, was designated F. solani (Mart.) Sacc. f. sp. glycines form. nov. Cultural and morphological characteristics of F. solani form B, the cause of seedling disease and root rot of soybean, and Plectosphaerella cucumerina were compared to determine the validity of a report indicating that they were conspecific. Results demonstrated that F. solani form B and P. cucumerina are distinctly different and not conspecific. The relevance of identifying and recognizing the two F. solani forms as separate and distinct members of the F. solani pathogen complex on soybean is discussed.},

Shipping did not significantly affect numbers of nematodes extracted. More second-stage juveniles (J2) were extracted with Baermann funnels than with an elutriator, probably because incubation of encysted eggs on the Baermann funnel for 1 week allowed hatching to occur. Sieving was more efficient than elutriation for extracting cysts. Adding air agitation to the water pressure during elutriation increased extraction efficiency of cysts but not J2. Sample sizes of 250 cm(3) and 500 cm(3) did not influence extraction efficiency of cysts; however, sample size did influence extraction of J2.},

Soybean accessions with resistance to Races 3, 5, and 14 have been identified. Data on reaction of these accessions for Races 1 and 2 are not available. Our objective was to bioassay these accessions for resistance to H. glycines Races 1 and 2. Eighty-six accessions, host differentials, and susceptible control were bioassayed during 1995 to 1996 for each of the two Races in thermoregulated water baths in the greenhouse. The results indicated that 52 accessions had resistance to H. glycines Race 1, and 24 accessions had resistance to Race 2, respectively. Soybean PIs 89772, 90763, 404166, 404198A, 437654, 437690, 438489B, 567491A, and 567516C were either resistant or moderately resistant to both Races. These are potential resistance sources to H. glycines Races 1, and 2 for developing resistant soybean cultivars. These PI lines are being fingerprinted by means or molecular markers to identify the unique lines to allow broadening the diversity of resistance gene utilization.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, has caused severe damage to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] worldwide since its discovery in 1954. 'Peking' is one of the most important sources in breeding SCN resistant soybean cultivars because it is resistant to Races 1, 3, and 5. Genetic information on SCN Races 1, 3, and 5 from Peking is essential to efficiently develop resistant soybean cultivars. Resistance to Race 3 in Peking was found to be controlled by three genes, but little is known on the inheritance of resistance to Races 1 and 5, and whether alleles conditioning resistance to Races 1 and 5 belong to the same linkage group and are allelic to genes giving resistance to Race 3. To determine the genetic bases of resistance to SCN Races 1, 3, and 5, Peking was crossed to the susceptible line 'Essex' to generate F-1 hybrids. The F-2 population and F-2:3 families were advanced from the F-1 and evaluated for resistance to SCN Race isolates 1, 3, and 5. Resistance to H. glycines Race isolates 1, 3, and 5 in Peking was found to be conditioned by three genes, one dominant and two recessive (Rhg, rhg, rhg). Peking may share similar sets of resistance loci between Races 1 and 3, but not between Races 3 and 5, or between Races 1 and 5.},

Hyphae of the Scytalidium-like fungus (CBS 645.97 and IMI 368886) proliferated in the gelatinous matrix of the egg mass and penetrated the eggshell via a penetration peg. Parasitism of the egg mass greatly lowered the hatch I ate of M. javanica juveniles in vitro. Application of the fungus to soil did not inhibit juvenile penetration into tomato roots. However, the nematode population in soil treated,vith the fungus was lower than in non-treated soil after one nematode generation.

	Abstract = {Five isolates of Fusarium solani, originally isolated from diseased soybean roots in the Red River Valley (RRV) of Minnesota and North Dakota, were evaluated for their ability to cause symptoms on 10 genetically diverse soybean cultivars. Taproots of 2-week-old plants were inoculated with F. solani-infested oat kernels, and 3 and 10 weeks later, plants were evaluated for root rot and foliar symptoms. At 3 weeks after inoculation, taproots of all cultivars had extensive reddish brown to black lesions; root rot severity (1-6 scale) ranged from 4.8 to 5.1, and 3.5% of the plants had died. Foliar symptoms were not observed. At 10 weeks after inoculation, all cultivars showed extensive decay of taproots and >50% of lateral roots were necrotic; root rot severity (1-4 scale) ranged from 2.7 to 3.7, and 42.5% of the plants had died. Foliar symptoms were first observed between the R-l to R-6 growth stages (about 5 weeks after inoculation) on the lower leaves and consisted of chlorosis at the margins that progressed inward. Veins initially were green, but leaves eventually became chlorotic, then necrotic, and fell with petioles still attached to the stem. In some cases, all of the foliage died. There was no significant (P = 0.05) isolate x cultivar interaction for root rot at 3 or 10 weeks after inoculation or for severity of foliar symptoms. Thirty-three cultivars commonly grown in southern Minnesota and the RRV were evaluated for reaction to one isolate of F. solani. Root rot severity ranged from 4.2 to 5.7 (1-6 scale) and 3.5 to 4.0 (1-4 scale), at 3 and 9 weeks after inoculation, respectively, and >50% of the plants died by 9 weeks after inoculation. Severity of foliar symptoms was low. These results indicate that isolates of F. solani from the RRV cause root rot and foliar symptoms on soybean and that cultivars grown in the region lack resistance to this pathogen. Foliar symptoms were not identical to those associated with sudden death syndrome.},

	Abstract = {The use of resistant cultivars is the most effective method for controlling soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinoe; SCN) on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]. However, resistance to SCN is oligogenic, making inheritance patterns complex and breeding difficult. One major partial-resistance locus for SCN resistance is located on molecular Linkage group (MLG) 'G'. This locus controls more than 50% of variation associated with response to SCN and resistant alleles are present in many important sources of SCN resistance, including PI 209332, PI 88788, PI 90763, PI 437654, and 'Peking'. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) Linked to the major SCN resistance alleles on MLG G have proven effective in tracking the alleles and predicting SCN response. These RFLPs are much more efficient in terms of time and labor than greenhouse assays for SCN. Nevertheless, more efficient DNA markers are needed to screen the many lines required for marker-assisted selection. Polymerase chain reaction-based markers, such as microsatellites (simple sequence repeats), have been sought because they are faster, less expensive, more polymorphic, and require less labor than RFLPs. In this study, we report two microsatellites, BARC-Satt038 and BARC-Satt130, that flank the major SCN resistance locus on MLG G. These microsatellites efficiently identify the chromosome fragment carrying the resistance allele and are also good predictors of SCN phenotype response.},

	Abstract = {Soil infested with the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, was amended with poultry litter in a three-year study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the organic amendment for improving soybean productivity and reducing damage by the nematode. Poultry litter was split-applied at V2 and V5 stages of soybean development, at rates of 0, 5 or 10 t ha(-1). The experimental plots were in Wicomico County, MD, and planted to Manokin (resistant) and Essex (susceptible) soybean cultivars. Cyst index was inversely correlated with poultry litter, although the difference between the 5 t ha(-1) and 10 t ha(-1) treatment was not significant. Poultry litter had a greater impact on reducing cyst infestation in Essex. Over the three-year period, cyst index increased incrementally on Manokin but this was significantly lower than on Essex. Nodule number and foliar N content were depressed by application of poultry litter. Shoot and root dry weight were improved by amending soil with 5 t ha(-1) poultry litter, but were reduced by the 10 t ha(-1) rate. Seed yield of both cultivars also tended to be reduced by 10 t ha(-1) poultry litter treatment, but stimulated by the 5 t ha(-1) treatment. The results indicate that 5 t ha -1 poultry litter is an effective means of improving productivity when soybean is grown in SCN-infested soil.},

	Abstract = {Nematodes produced in monoxenic culture are used for many research purposes. To maximize the number of Heterodera glycines produced in culture, 24 soybean cultivars (maturity groups 0-8) were evaluated for host suitability. A strain of H. glycines race 3, maintained in monoxenic culture on excised soybean root tips of cv. Kent, was inoculated into 20 petri dishes of each cultivar. The highest numbers of first-generation females per petri dish were produced on cultivars Bass, Williams 82, Kent, Proto, and Chapman, and the lowest on cultivars Lambert and Chesapeake. A diapause-like period with decreased nematode production was recorded on some cultivars but not others. Six generations of cultivation on CY 366 did not affect the number of females produced. The results indicated that soybean maturity group could not be used as a parameter for selecting the optimum cultivars for nematode production, and that only 12 petri dishes needed to be counted to determine a 60-female difference per petri dish among cultivars. This study demonstrated that H. glycines populations in monoxenic culture can be more than quadrupled by selection of an appropriate soybean cultivar.},

	Abstract = {Three cDNAs encoding serine proteinases (HGSPI-III) were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from feeding females of Heterodera glycines. The library was screened with three separate serine proteinase gene fragments amplified from cDNA of H. glycines using consensus oligonucleotide primers. Each predicted protein contains a secretion signal sequence, a propeptide and a mature protein of 226-296 amino acids. One of the predicted enzymes, HGSP-II has 41% identity to a chymotrypsin-like enzyme from the mollusc, Haliotis rufescens, and analysis of key residues involved in substrate binding also suggests a chymotrypsin-like specificity. HGSP-I and HGSP-III show greatest homology to kallikreins but sequence analysis does not allow prediction of their substrate preferences. Southern blot analysis suggests that HGSP-II and HGSP-III are encoded by single-copy genes in contrast to HGSP-I which may have two or more homologues. The regions encoding the mature proteinases were cloned into an expression vector and recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. Both HGSP-I and HGSP-II were shown, after refolding, to cleave the synthetic peptide N-CBZ-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, and this activity could be inhibited by the cowpea trypsin inhibitor, CpTI. HGSP-III showed no activity against the synthetic substrates tested. The information gained from these studies indicates that serine proteinases are an important group of enzymes in H. glycines and further characterization will aid the development of a proteinase inhibitor-based approach for transgenic plant resistance to plant parasitic nematodes.

	Abstract = {Tannins, which are water-soluble polyphenols, are toxic to numerous fungi, bacteria, and yeasts. Our objectives were to study the efficacy of tannic acid in control of Meloidogyne arenaria on tomato and its effects on the behavior of M. arenaria, M. incognita, Heterodera glycines, and Radopholus similis. Three concentrations of tannic acid, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 g/500 cm(3) of soil, were applied preplant (powder) and at-plant (powder and drench) into soil infested with M. arenaria. Tannic acid at the 1.0-g rate reduced galling compared dth the untreated control, regardless of methods of application. The 0.1-g rate resulted in no reduction in galling when applied preplant but reduced galling when applied as a drench and in one of two experiments when applied at-plant. The 10-g rate was phytotoxic to tomato seedlings except when applied 7 days preplant. In the latter case, root galling was suppressed to very low numbers. In behavior studies on water agar, Meloidogyne second-stage juveniles were attracted to areas with an increasing tannic acid gradient. Radopholus similis was repelled from the tannic acid gradient in one of two experiments. There was no effect on H. glycines. The response of M. arenaria second-stage juveniles to different concentrations of tannic acid dissolved in alginate was tested. Movement behavior of the second-stage juveniles were observed at 1,000 and 10,000 mu g/ml of tannic acid, but not at 10 and 100 mu g/ml.},

In this study, over 800 soybean plant introductions (PIs), lines, and cultivars were screened for resistance to Fusarium solani. Of 728 PIs from China, PI 567.374 had mean foliar SDS severities significantly (P = 0.05) lower than PI 520.733 (resistant check) in both growth-chamber and greenhouse tests. In addition, PIs 567.315, 567.441C, 567.650B, and 567.664 had mean SDS severity ratings significantly (P = 0.05) lower than PI 520.733 in a growth-chamber test. Of 16 soybean cyst nematode-resistant entries tested, 5 had values lower than the resistant check, PI 520.733, with cv. Hartwig significantly lower in the first trial. In trial two, no entries were lower than the resistant check, although cvs. Bell and Hartwig were not significantly different from PI 520.733. In another experiment, few soybean cultivars or experimental lines had SDS severity ratings lower than PI 520.733 in any one of three trials. Some of the newly acquired PIs from China that exhibited low foliar SDS severity ratings may provide the sources of resistance needed to develop new SDS-resistant soybean breeding lines and cultivars.},

Arabidopsis thaliana is not a regular host of this nematode, but invasion, feeding site induction and in rare cases development of juveniles was observed. Compared to Heterodera schachtii, which interacts compatibly with A. thaliana, the period of invasion and migration was prolonged. During migration a strong hypersensitive response, characterized by extensive necroses, browning, autofluorescence and cell wall depositions, occurred in cells that were not in direct contact with the nematodes. Cells selected as initial syncytial cells were pierced with the stylet and, after having passed a preparation phase, secretions were released. The cells responded with rapid vacuolation and deposition of callose-like material around the styler and at the cell walls. and subsequent necrosis. In a very few cases the initial syncytial cells and neighbouring cells deposited callose-like material on their walls, but these cells remained intact so that functional syncytia developed, which allowed occasional nematode development.},

The lumen of the esophagus is circular through the procorpus and triradiate in the metacorpus where it is part of the metacorpus pump valve. A pair of esophageal lumen branches terminate as quadriradiate valves id the subventral gland ampullae. The central lumen extends posteriad to become part of the esophago-intestinal valve. The enlarged intestinal lumen is delineated by scattered evaginated membranes of the epithelial cells. The lumen may be occluded during nonfeeding periods or when the intestine becomes compressed by the reproductive organs. The testis contains spermatocytes with membrane-bound nuclei that transform into amoeboid spermatids with electron-opaque, nonmembrane-bound nuclei surrounded by fibrous bodies.;Spermatozoa with irregular clumps of nonmembrane-bound chromatin surrounded by mitochondria as well as residual fibrous bodies were found in seminal vesicles and vas deferens of males and in spermathecae of female gonads. The ultrastructure of the male and female reproductive organs is compared to similar features observed with light microscopy and LTSEM.},

The lumen wall may be laterally appressed or opened into a stellate form in the glandular region. Posteriad from the esophagointestinal valve, the cylindroid lumen becomes partially occluded with microvilli formed by the evaginations of the apical membranes of the intestinal epithelium, Cross sections, through this region reveal that groups of 5 radiating epithelial cells are joined near the lumen surface by junctional complexes. The alimentary canal terminates via a rectal valve and channel supported by somatic and neural cells. The central nervous system consists of a nerve ring that surrounds the muscular region of the esophagus. Related neurons support chemoreceptors and tactoreceptors of sensilla and the extensive coelomyarian and meromyarian somatic muscles. Extensive accumulations of glycogen rosettes are present in many of the muscle and hypodermal cells.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, is one of the most economically important pathogens of soybean. Effective management of the nematode is often dependent on the planting of resistant soybean cultivars. During the past 40 years, more than 60 soybean genotypes and plant introductions (PI) have been reported as resistant to H. glycines. About 130 modern soybean cultivars registered in the United States are resistant to certain races of H. glycines. Several resistance genes have been identified and genetically mapped; however, resistance levels in many soybean cultivars are not durable. Some older cultivars are no longer resistant to certain H. glycines populations in many production areas, especially if a soybean monoculture has been practiced. Past soybean registration reports show that all resistant cultivars developed in public institutions from the mid-1960s to the present have been derived from five PIs. This narrow genetic background is fragile. To further complicate the issue, soybean-H. glycines genetic interactions are complex and poorly understood. Studies to identify soybean resistance genes sometimes have overlapped, and the same genes may have been reported several times and designated by different names. Nevertheless, many potential resistance genes in existing germplasm resources have not yet been characterized. Clearly, it is necessary to identify new resistance genes, develop more precise selection methods, and integrate these resistance genes into new cultivars. Rational deployment of resistant cultivars is critical to future sustained soybean production.},

	Abstract = {Soyabean (Glycine max) cultivars in the USA, which are resistant to soyabean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines), have resistance derived from only a few plant introductions (PIs). Many other SCN resistant PIs have been identified which could be used as sources for broadening the diversity of resistance genes in cultivars. The objectives of this research were to study the relationship among PIs with SCN resistance using RFLP markers and to assess their resistance response to five races of H. glycines. Thirty-eight PIs previously reported as being resistant to one or more SCN races were evaluated for resistance to H. glycines races 1, 2, 3, 5 and 14 in a greenhouse and were tested with 201 genomic DNA clones. PI437654 and PI438489B were resistant to all five SCN races. Four PIs were resistant to four SCN races, nine resistant to three races, four resistant to two races, four resistant to one race and the remainder had only moderate resistance or moderate susceptibility to one or more races. The PIs were polymorphic for 138 clones which revealed 301 polymorphic DNA fragments. The groupings of the PIs for both cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were associated with resistance responses to races of H. glycines. One major group of PIs was distant from all previously used sources of resistance. These PIs had only moderate resistance to race 3 but could potentially provide new genes for resistance to this race. The other PIs were in groups that included PIs with resistance sources previously used by breeders. This information on the relationship of the PIs should help researchers developing resistant soyabean cultivars to identify sources of SCN resistance which are not closely related to previously used sources.},

	Abstract = {Researchers have indicated that the C-g fatty acid, pelargonic acid (nonanoic acid), has considerable nematicidal activity that could be increased by derivitization and improved emulsification. Microemulsions of methyl and ethylene glycol esters of pelargonic acid developed by Mycogen Corporation (San Diego, CA) were tested for nematicidal activity against root-knot and soybean cyst nematodes. All treatments were compared to a deionized water control and a microemulsion "blank" (minus active ingredient). Methyl pelargonate reduced gall numbers at concentrations greater than or equal to 0.8 mu l a.i./liter, and ethylene glycol pelargonate reduced gall numbers at greater than or equal to 6.4 pi a.i./liter in a laboratory bioassay of Meloidogyne javanica on roots of tomato seedlings. Microscopic observation of treated M. javanica second-stage juveniles suggested that methyl pelargonate was toxic to nematodes at concentrations as low as 0.2 mu l a.i./liter. Cysts of Heterodera glycines per gram of root were significantly reduced by weekly soil drenches of methyl pelargonate at 6.4, 3.2, and 1.6 mu l a.i./liter compared to controls in one greenhouse experiment. Weekly soil drenches of methyl pelargonate at 4.8 or 3.2 mu l a.i./liter also significantly reduced the number of eggs produced by M. incognita on soybean in a greenhouse test. In both greenhouse tests with soybean, rates of methyl pelargonate greater than or equal to 4.8 mu l a.i./liter had considerable phytotoxicity. No significant interaction of chemical treatment and different soil mixtures affected the nematode numbers produced or plant vigor observed. Soil drenches with microemulsions of methyl pelargonate at 3.2 mu l a.i./liter applied weekly, or as two initial applications, were effective as a nematicide for root-knot and soybean cyst nematodes with negligible effects on plant vigor.},

Resolving power can serve as a close estimate of the confidence interval of QTL map location, as well as a guide to the lower efficient limit of marker spacing in an initial marker-QTL mapping experiment. In the present study, an extensive series of simulations was carried out to provide estimates of resolving power, for backcross (BC) and F2 designs, over a wide range of experimental sizes and of gene effects and dominance at the QTL. From the simulation results, the remarkably simple expressions, 3000/(mNd2) (where m = 1 for BC and m = 2 for F2; N = population size, and d = allele substitution effect) and 530/N? (in terms of ?, the proportion of variance explained), were obtained for estimating resolving power. These expressions can provide a convenient guide to planning marker spacing in BC and F2 marker-QTL linkage experiments and for placing confidence intervals about QTL map location obtained in such experiments.},

	Abstract = {Several sources of soyabean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines; SCN) resistance have been identified in soyabean (Glycine max). This study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci that control disease response in three commonly used sources of SCN resistance. Genetic markers were used to analyse three segregating soyabean F2 populations (Evans x Peking, Evans x PI90763, and Evans x PI88788), and the results were compared with those of a previous study involving PI209332. For the Peking, PI90763, and PI209332 populations, races 1, 3 and 6 were used as SCN inoculum; for the PI88788 population, only races 3 and 6 were used. To uncover putative resistance loci, F2 DNA marker genotypes at between 63 and 99 loci in each population were contrasted with cyst indices averaged from 12 F2:3 progeny individuals. Four independent partial SCN resistance loci were uncovered at P P < 0.0001 in all populations and races tested. Other significant loci included one near RFLP A378H at the opposite end of linkage group G from C006V, another on linkage group J near marker B032V-1, and a fourth on linkage group N near marker A280Hae-1. Comparisons between different SCN races indicated that some of the putative resistance loci behave in a race-specific manner. These results may serve as a resource for SCN researchers and soyabean breeders by summarizing a wide range of genetic data on the soyabean-SCN interaction.},

Snyd. & Hans.] and soybean cyst nematode (SCN) race 3 (caused by Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) sometimes occurs in crosses among adapted cultivars. Our objective was to characterize the loci underlying this coinheritance. One hundred thirty DNA markers were compared with SDS disease response and SCN score among 100 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between SDS and SCN resistant 'Forrest' and SDS and SCN susceptible 'Essex'. SDS disease incidence (DI) was determined in replicated sites during 4 yr encompassing five locations. The SCN score was determined in the greenhouse from naturally infested held soil samples. Two separate genomic regions identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers OI03(450) and OW15(400) were associated with mean SCN score (P = 0.0001) and jointly accounted for about 47% of variability in SCN score, OI03(450) identified a QTL for resistance to SCN (R-2 = 14%) within a genomic region that was strongly associated with SDS DI (R-2 = 20%), partly explaining the coinheritance of the two traits. This locus could be assigned to the region of linkage group G already known to encompass the major SCN resistance locus.},

	Abstract = {A 2 year field study was designed to determine if soybean-wheat double-cropping and reduced or no tillage altered the soil mycoflora antagonistic to the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Six treatments were sampled monthly: disc 10 cm deep, followed by roller harrow; chisel plow 20 cm deep, followed by disc and roller harrow; moldboard plow 15 cm deep, followed by disc and roller harrow; non-tillage in the previous year's soybean stubble (NT-Soy); non-tillage in standing wheat cover crop (NT-1); non-tillage after wheat cover crop (NT-7). Each treatment had been applied to the same plots for up to 7 years. At appropriate monthly intervals, nematode cysts, females, and eggs were collected and assayed for the presence of fungi, which were identified to species-level taxa. Effects of cropping-tillage regimes on numbers of infective juveniles, numbers of eggs within cysts, and vertical distribution of cysts were determined. Similarities of egg and female mycofloras in this study to those of previous studies were examined. A total of 61 species-level fungal taxa were identified, along with 20 non-sporulating isolates distinguished from one another by appearance, growth pattern, and color. Fusarium solani was the most frequent of 47 species infesting cysts. Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum were the most frequent of 20 taxa isolated from field-collected females; in females produced on soybean plants grown in field soil in the greenhouse, F. oxysporum was the most frequent of 21 taxa. Paecilomyces lilacinus was the most common fungus among the 38 species isolated from eggs. For all fungi, percentages of parasitized females and eggs were similar in all treatments, but some treatments affected the parasitism rates of Paecilomyces lilacinus and Verticillium chlamydosporium. Parasitism of females was relatively low in July and August, but tripled in September. Egg parasitism was generally below 10% regardless of sampling time. Vertical distribution of cysts had no discernible effect on sampling precision, since cysts were concentrated in the top 25 cm in two dissimilar treatments (moldboard plow, NT-7). No consistent treatment effects were seen on densities of soil-borne infective juveniles in winter or spring, nor on average numbers of eggs per cyst. Based on similarity indices among this study and four previous studies, a biogeography of H. glycines mycofloras is proposed.},

Changes in female index from slightly 10% of the test cultivars compared to 'Lee' resulted in a change of most of the race designations after at least three generations on 'Essex.' Variation due to race was the greatest source of variation in the analysis of the data and was three to nine times the second largest source of variation. In most cases. female indices for the cultivars within a race were not different (P = 0.05).

Although no above-ground symptoms of nematode infection were visible, mean yield was 16-32% greater for Asgrow 5979 than for Hutcheson. Yield for Deltpine 415 was similar to that of Asgrow 5979 in the field infested with race 3 and similar to that of Hutcheson in the race 14-infested field. Hartwig produced lower yields than Asgrow 5979 in both fields. Yield differences, particularly between Asgrow 5979 and Hutcheson, were attributed primarily to nematodes because both cultivars have been shown to produce similar yields in the absence of H. glycines. This study illustrates the importance of knowing which race of the nematode is prevalent in a field and demonstrates that the nematode can cause significant yield loss in the absence of visible symptoms of infection.},

Not only do generation times of predacious nematodes often appear to exclude their having a significant impart on peaks of plant-feeding nematodes but also there is accumulating evidence that bacterial-feeding nematodes make a greater contribution to their diet than do plant-feeding nematodes. Greater plant yields after attempts to stimulate biological control of plant-feeding nematodes may result from an increased number of predacious nematodes enhancing the cycling of plant nutrients rather than a reduction in root herbivory.},

In the first experiment, cysts of both race 3 and race 4 were exposed to leachate of 8-week-old plants for a 2-week period. In the second experiment, cysts from populations of races 3 and 4 were raised on cultivars A2575, A3127, and Williams 82. Cysts then were exposed to leachate from 8-week-old plants for a 2-week period in all possible race-per-cultivar combinations. In the third experiment, cysts of races 3 and 4 were exposed at 4-day intervals to leachate from plants as the plants developed eloped 7 to 59 days after planting. In experiments 1 and 2, leachate from 8-week-old Williams 82 and A3127 stimulated more hatch and emergence of H. glycines than leachate from A2575, Fayette, or the control. In the first experiment, cumulative hatch and emergence were greater for race 3 than for race 4. In experiment 2, no apparent relationship developed between leachate from a cultivar and the population developed on that cultivar in terms of stimulation of hatch and emergence. In the third experiment, A2575 stimulated more hatch and emergence of both race 3 and race 4 than A3127, Fayette, and Williams 82. Leachate fi om Fayette stimulated less hatch and emergence of both race 3 and race 4. Hatch and emergence were greatest during the initial 12 days of the experiment.},

An isolate of Pasteuria, recovered from the pigeonpea cyst nematode, Heterodera cajani, was characterised using host range, spore morphometrics, and serology. The spores of this isolate had a mean diameter of 2.36 mu m, the smallest described so far on nematodes. Based on spore encumberance on nematode cuticle, Globodera rostochiensis, G. pallida, Heterodera glycines, H. trifolii, H. schachtii, and Rotylenchulus reniformis were hosts and H. carotae, H. galeopsidis, Meloidogyne arenaria, M. incognita, M. javanica, M. graminicola, M. oryzae, M. triticoryzae, M. sasseri, M. graminis, and M. naasi were non hosts. Spore attachment on the nematode body was random except on H. trifolii, where the spores selectively attached to the head region. Marked heterogeneity in sport size and level of spore attachment within populations of nematode species was observed. Variation in antigens present on the spore surface was confirmed by differential recognition of spores by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and Western blot analysis. The parameters important in characterising species of Pasteuria are discussed in the light of the data reported. The results suggest that host range and spore morphometrics are not adequate for the characterisation of species.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome, caused by strains of Fusarium solani, has been recognized as an important disease of soybean (Glycine max) in the southern United States for more than 20 years, but has only recently become more prevalent and severe in northern soybean production areas. Little is known about environmental factors that influence root infection and above-ground symptom expression in this pathosystem We established quantitative relationships between soil temperature, the matric component of soil water potential (psi(m)), and disease development in controlled conditions. Soil temperature in the range of 15 to 30 degrees C was manipulated in pots equipped with heating tapes, and soil moisture was manipulated by withholding irrigation water until psi(m) reached threshold values of -0.003, -0.02, -0.05, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, or -0.8 MPa; when psi(m) for a given moisture treatment had reached its threshold, the pots belonging to this treatment were watered until the soil was saturated. The most important results were that i) soil temperature differentially influenced the development of root symptoms and foliar symptoms, with the former being most severe at low temperatures (15 degrees C) and the latter being most severe at intermediate temperatures (22 to 24 degrees C); ii) the severity of foliar symptoms decreased rapidly with decreasing soil moisture and was negatively correlated with the number of days the average psi(m) was lower than -0.01 MPa; and iii) there was no close correlation between root disease severity and foliar disease severity. The relationships between psi(m) and disease derived in controlled conditions were confirmed in a field irrigation trial. The information provided here, when used together with long-term temperature data and regional soil moisture maps, should be valuable in assessing the risk that sudden death syndrome will continue to expand into previously unaffected production areas.},

Litters (manure and pine-shaving bedding) from a research facility and a commercial broiler house were used. Treatments consisted of 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% litter by dry weight of soil for each kind of litter. Three control treatments consisted of soil not amended with litter, with and without nematodes, and one treatment to which mineral fertilizer was added at a nitrogen rate equivalent to that of the 0.5% litter rate, with nematodes. Microplots were inoculated at planting with 200 eggs/100 cm(3) soil in 1993 and 1,000 eggs/100 cm(3) soil in 1994. At 92 and 184 days after planting, nematode population densities decreased linearly with increasing rates of litter. Nematode numbers at midseason were larger in plots treated with mineral fertilizer than in plots treated with a rate of litter equivalent to the 0.5% rate. Fungal and bacterial population densities fluctuated throughout the growing season. Bacterial numbers had a positive linear relationship, with increasing rates of litter only in October 1993; however, significant positive relationships were observed throughout the 1994 growing season. In 1994, nematode population density at 92 days after planting decreased linearly with increasing bacterial numbers 30 days after planting. No other significant relationships between nematode densities and microbial densities were observed. Fungi and bacteria isolated from the litter and litter-amended soil were identified. Fungal genera isolated included Acremonium, Aspergillus, Eurotium, Paecilomyces, Petriella, and Scopulariopsis, whereas bacteria genera included Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas.},

Fifty cysts of a race 5 population were introduced into plots in a field with no history of soybean production and that had been in sod for 20 years. Soybean cultivars either susceptible or resistant to H. glycines were grown either in monoculture or rotated with maize in a 2-year rotation. During the first 5 years, resistant cultivars with the Peking source of resistance were planted. After year 5, monoculture of Peking resistance resulted in 18 cysts/250 cm(3) of soil, whereas populations resulting from the continuous cropping of susceptible soybean resulted in 45 cysts/250 cm(3). Some plots in all treatments, including control plots, were contaminated at the end of year 5. Crop rotation delayed population development of H. glycines. During years 6 through 11 cv. Fayette (PI88.788 source of resistance) was planted. In year 6 numbers of cysts declined to 1/250 cm(3) of soil in the treatment consisting of monocultured Fayette. At the end of year 10, cysts were below the detection level in all treatments in which Fayette was planted. Yield of susceptible soybean in monoculture with or without H. glycines infestation was lower beginning in year 6 when compared to yield of soybean grown in rotation and remained lower throughout the duration of the experiment except for 1987 (year 9). Yields of susceptible and resistant soybean were different each year except for drought years in 1980 and 1988. From 1979 to 1982 differences in yield were due to lower yield potential of resistant cultivars. Except for the drought year, yield of cv.

Appel & Wollenw. emend. Snyd. & Hans. Lines were rated for disease incidence (DI, 0-100%), disease severity CDS, 1-9), and the reproductive growth stage (R). The DI and DS were standardized to the full pod (R6) growth stage. Disease index was calculated as DI x DS/9, with a possible range of 0 (no disease) to 100 (all plants dead). Lines were also characterized in the greenhouse as resistant or susceptible to soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) Races 3 and 14. The group of SCN resistant Lines was significantly less susceptible to SDS than the SCN susceptible group in three of the six environments. In Pulaski 1991, lines with SCN Race 3 and 14 resistance were significantly more susceptible to SDS on average than the SCN susceptible lines and than the lines with SCN Race 3 resistance only. Multigenic inheritance was implicated because the frequency distributions of SDS response were continuous with a large range (8-12 times the standard error of a line mean) in all environments and were unimodal in all but one environment. On the basis of line means, heritability estimates within environment ranged from 0.68 to 0.83 and across environments were 0.75, indicating that soybean response to SDS is highly heritable. There was a significant genotype x environment interaction in these lines emphasizing the need for multiple environment testing for effective selection of stable resistance to SDS.},

	Abstract = {The soybean PI 437654 is resistant to all known races of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in the U.S.A. and became a new source of resistance genes in cultivar development. Race 3, a wide-ranging nematode pathotype, was used to examine root cells of PI 437654 and susceptible 'Essex', 2, 3, and 5 days after inoculation (DAI). In initial response to SCN, both genotypes formed syncytia by cell wall dissolutions. Hypertrophy of syncytium component cells and hyperplasia of cells near syncytia were observed. At 2 DAI, incompatible response of PI 437654 to SCN was exhibited: limited cell hypertrophy, inhibition of syncytium growth, initiation of necrosis, and wall appositions. At 3 DAI, cellular events appeared to be a sum of the operative mechanisms for SCN resistance: irregular wall thickening, pronounced wall appositions, necrosis, and nuclear breakdown followed by cytoplasmic collapse. The cells surrounding the syncytia showed necrosis, wall apposition, and accumulation of electron-dense bodies. By 5 DAI, syncytia and neighboring cells were totally devoid of ground plasma and the degeneration process was completed. The normal route for early syncytium development in 'Essex' (increased number of organelles, intense vacuolization, accumulation of dense deposits in vacuoles, and wall ingrowths) suggests the involvement of portions of the developmental pathway of differentiating tissues in organogenesis. Early onset of SCN resistance 2 DAI in PI 437654 suggests rapid activation of genes in a cascade reaction leading to cell death.},

The cleavage of Z-Phe-Arg-MNA was sensitive to inhibition by a combination of Oc-I Delta D86 and cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify fragments of cysteine proteinase genes from 2 cyst-nematodes, H. glycines and Globodera pallida. Comparison of the H. glycines fragment with known genes established highest homology to cathepsin L-like genes.

	Abstract = {The effects of planting date and soybean maturity group on population densities of Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), and soybean yield in the presence of this pathogen were determined in two series of factorial experiments. The first series of experiments evaluated May- versus June-planted soybean of mio maturity groups (V and VII-early vs late maturity) with and without nematicide treatments at four North Carolina locations (environments) in 1986 and 1987. The second series of experiments concerned three planting dates (April, May and June) with four soybean maturity groups (IV-VII) at a total of six locations between 1989-1992. Delayed soybean planting resulted in a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduction in the initial population density (Pi) of SCN. The effects of planting date on final population densities (Pf) of SCN were usually significant, but not predictably so. Environmental differences associated with locations and planting date likely account for the significantly higher or lower Pf. Late-maturing soybean cultivars consistently resulted in greater SCN Pf at season's end than did early maturing cultivars (P=0.0001). Soybean yields were increased by nematicides in early plantings (P=0.05), but not in late plantings, probably a result of the attrition of SCN Pi in response to late planting. Mid-May planted soybean yields generally were the greatest of all planting dates.},

Most of the cyst-resistant soybean cultivars tested were susceptible to M. arenaria and M. javanica. Exceptionally large galls were induced by M. arenaria on roots of Asgrow 5979, Hartwig, and CNS soybean. Hartwig soybean and PI 437654 were resistant to all cultured field populations of cyst nematodes in a first greenhouse test. In the second test, cyst indices of 11.3% and 19.4% were observed on roots of PI 437654 and Hartwig, respectively, when infected with an inbred line (OP50) of H. glycines corresponding to race 4. The cyst-resistant soybean germplasm tested, including Hartwig and PI 437654, supported only low numbers of reniform nematodes.

The identification and characterization of these molecules are of fundamental importance and may help to facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with nematode infection of plants and thereby decrease nematode-induced damage to crops. An antibody-based approach was used to isolate molecules present on the nematode surface and in nematode secretions. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced to secretions and to whole Heterodera avenae 2nd-stage juveniles; several of these MAbs recognized molecules present in nematode secretions produced in vitro. Three of these molecules have been partly characterized in H. avenae, Globodera rostochiensis, G. pallida and Meloidogyne incognita. A MAb reacting with the surfaces of these nematodes recognized antigens of different molecular weight in each of the species tested. This difference in antigenicity might be related to specific functions in these nematodes. Preliminary results show that this antibody also localized the antigen in root cells surrounding the feeding site induced by M. incognita in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

	Abstract = {A major partial-resistance locus to the soyabean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines; SCN) was identified on linkage group G of soyabean (Glycine max) using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). This locus explained 51.4% (LOD = 10.35) of the total phenotypic variation in disease response in soyabean PI209332, 52.7% (LOD = 15.58) in PI90763, 40.0% (LOD = 10.50) in PI88788, and 28.1% (LOD = 6.94) in cv. Peking. Initially, the region around this major resistance locus was poorly populated with DNA markers. To increase marker density in this genomic region, first random, and later targeted, comparative mapping with RFLPs from mungbean (Vigna radiata) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was performed, eventually leading to one RFLP marker every 2.6 centimorgans (cM). Even with this marker density, the inability to resolve SCN disease response into discrete Mendelian categories posed a major limitation to mapping. Thus, qualitative scoring of SCN disease response was carried out in an F5:6 recombinant inbred population derived from Evans x PI209332 using a 30% disease index cut-off for resistance. Using the computer program JOINMAP, an integrated map of the region of interest was created, placing the SCN resistance locus 4.6 cM from RFLP marker B53 and 2.8 cM from Bng30. This study demonstrates how a combination of molecular-mapping strategies, including comparative genome analysis, join mapping, and qualitative scoring of a quantitative trait, potentially provide the necessary tools for high-resolution mapping around a quantitative-trait locus.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) is one of the most serious disease problems of soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merrill], but the genetic basis of SCN resistance is complex and poorly understood. This study was conducted to identify genomic regions that confer partial resistance to SCN in soybean PI 209332 through the use of DNA genetic markers. By testing three different races of SCN, we also assessed race-specificities of putative resistance loci. Mapping was performed in two related populations, one an F-2:3 population and the other an F-5:6 recombinant inbred line population, both derived from a single cross between 'Evans' and PI 209322. To identify resistance loci, SCN disease responses for all lines in the mapping populations were contrasted with DNA marker genotypes at 98 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marker loci spread throughout the soybean genome. A major partial-resistance locus on linkage group 'G' (P < 0.0001) near RFLP marker C006V was effective against all three SCN race isolates tested. This locus explained 35% of total phenotypic variation in the SCN disease response to a Race 1 SCN population, 50% of the response to a Race 3 SCN population, and 54% of the response to a Race 6 SCN population. Additional putative SCN resistance loci (P < 0.002) were identified on soybean linkage groups 'D', 'J', 'L', and 'K'. Detecting some of these minor loci was complicated by strong masking phenotypic effects of the major resistance locus near C006V. Some of the putative resistance loci behaved in a race-specific manner. Based on RFLP genotype at the F-2 generation, marker-assisted selection for the resistance locus on linkage group 'G' was evaluated and found to be 90% accurate in selecting F-5:6 lines resistant to SCN, comparable in accuracy to phenotypic selection for SCN resistance.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera glycines is the most damaging root pathogen of soybean in the United States. Plant introduction (PI) 90.763 is resistant to both races 3 and 5, whereas PI 424.595 is resistant only to race 5. Genetic relationships in these PI lines for resistance to H. glycines are not known. Crosses between PI 90.763 and PI 424.595 and susceptible cv. Essex were studied in the F-1, F-2, and F-3 generations to compare the genes involved in resistance to race 3 with those for resistance to race 5. The F-2 plants also were studied separately for reaction to the two races by dividing roots into separate pots. Plants were screened using conventional techniques and classified as either resistant or susceptible based on an index of parasitism. Data were analyzed using chi-2 to determine goodness of fit between observed and expected genetic ratios. The cross PI 90.763 x Essex segregated 3 resistant: 13 susceptible plants in the F-2 generation, which indicated one dominant and one recessive gene, conditioned resistance to race 3. All progenies of the cross PI 424.595 x Essex, involving both susceptibles parents, were susceptible, indicating no genetic interaction. The cross of PI 90.763 x PI 424.595 showed monogenic inheritance with a dominant gene in PI 90.763. The divided root study of the cross PI 90.763 x Essex indicated that all race 5 resistant F-2 plants also were resistant to race 3, whereas, in the cross PI 90.763 x PI 424.595, some of the race 5 resistant plants were susceptible to race 3. Similarly, all plants susceptible to race 3 also were susceptible to race 5 in cross PI 90.763 x Essex, but not for PI 90.763 x PI 424.595. The results indicated that the dominant resistance gene and one of the recessive resistance genes in PI 90.763 which conditioned resistance to race 5 also imparted resistance to race 3. The additional recessive gene that controlled resistance to race 5 in PI 424.595 was ineffective against race 3.},

The RAPD results exhibited 100% association with greenhouse virulence assay results. Amplification patterns generated by RAPD reactions were used to generate a phenogram depicting the genetically distinct nature of the cluster defined by the SDS isolates.

Four near-isogenic soybean lines differing for maturity date were planted in microplots infested with a race 5 isolate of H. glycines. Soil temperature was monitored at a depth of 15 cm. Eggs of H. glycines, extracted from cysts collected monthly from each microplot, were used in hatching tests and bioassays to determine dormancy. Egg hatching and second-stage juvenile (J2) infectivity rates decreased sharply from their highest levels in midsummer (July-August) to a low level by October of each year and remained low (< 10% hatching and < 0.2 J2/cm root) until May or June of the following year. The patterns of numbers of females and eggs in the bioassays were similar. The decreases were not related to soil temperature and did not differ consistently among soybean isolines. The monophasic changes in all nematode responses with peak midsummer rates suggest that H. glycines produces one primary generation per year in central Missouri. Changes in hatching rates and the timing of minimum and maximum rates suggested that H. glycines eggs exhibit more than one type of dormancy.},

	Abstract = {Resistance to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is difficult to evaluate in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeding. PI 437.654 has resistance to more SCN race isolates than any other known soybean. We screened 298 F-6:7 recombinant-inbred lines from a cross between PI 437.654 and 'BSR101' for SCN race-3 resistance, genetically mapped 355 RFLP markers and the I locus, and tested these markers for association with resistance loci. The Rhg(4) resistance locus was within 1 cM of the I Locus on linkage group A. Two additional QTLs associated with SCN resistance were located within 3 cM of markers on groups G and M. These two loci were not independent because 91 of 96 lines that had a resistant-parent marker type on group G also had a resistant-parent marker type on group M. Rhg(4) and the QTL on G showed a significant interaction by together providing complete resistance to SCN race-3. Individually, the QTL on G had greater effect on resistance than did Rhg(4), but neither Locus alone provided a degree of resistance much different from the susceptible parent. The nearest markers to the mapped QTLs on groups A and C had allele frequencies from the resistant parent indicating 52 resistant lines in this population, a number not significantly different from the 55 resistant lines found. Therefore, no QTLs from PI 437.654 other than those mapped here are expected to be required for resistance to SCN race-3. All 50 lines that had the PI 437.654 marker type at the nearest marker to each of the QTLs on groups A and G were resistant to SCN race-3. We believe markers near to these QTLs can be used effectively to select for SCN race-3 resistance, thereby improving the ability to breed SCN-resistant soybean varieties.},

Soybean following sorghum-sudangrass yielded ill kg/ha more than soybean following fallow and 600 kg/ha more than continuous soybean. Aldicarb treatment increased yield by 428 kg/ha, regardless of previous crop. Cultivars interacted significantly with nematicide treatment and previous crop with respect to yield. Sorghum-sudangrass reduced numbers of Meloidogyne spp. compared with fallow and continuous soybean, but cropping system did not affect H. glycines numbers. The cultivar x previous crop and cultivar x nematicide interactions were significant for numbers of Meloidogyne spp, and H. glycines. We concluded that sorghum-sudangrass hybrid and fallow are effective in reducing yield losses caused by mixed populations of Meloidogyne and H. glycines.

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) (SCN) has become an increasing problem in the upper midwest. In order to develop appropriate practices to manage SCN populations it is important to understand the population dynamics of SCN under held conditions. Soybean cyst nematode population dynamics were determined in naturally infested commercial soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields in southern Minnesota on a monthly basis during 1991 and 1992 for an adapted susceptible (S) and a SCN Race 3 resistant (R) cultivar and three blends (25% R:75% S; 50% R:50% S; 75% R:25% S). Population dynamics differed between sites and years. In 1991, fields with similar initial cyst densities were compared. Densities of second-stage juveniles (J2) peaked in August at one site and gradually declined throughout the growing season at the other. Total cyst production was lower at the site where J2 densities declined. In 1992, fields with high and low initial egg densities were compared. SCN population densities increased when initial densities of J2 and eggs were low and decreased when initial J2 and egg densities were high. Physiological race of the nematode influenced population dynamics on resistant plants. The cyst index under field conditions for the resistant cultivar was 10 (moderately resistant) against Race 3 and 32 (moderately susceptible) against Race 1. The blends generally lowered SCN population densities, but not significantly. Final egg density and cyst production for the resistant cultivar were significantly lower than the susceptible cultivar at each site. The use of SCN resistant cultivars alone or in a 75:25% mixture with a susceptible cultivar (25%) is recommended as a SCN population management strategy to delay shifts from one race to another thus prolonging the effectiveness of resistant cultivars.},

Cyst, stunt, lesion, and spiral nematodes were consistently detected on different soil types during all growing seasons. When the reproductive capability of these 4 nematodes was assessed, location was a significant main effect reflecting responses to the different soil types. At a specific location, there were differences in nematode reproduction rates between rotations. Crop rotation significantly increased yield of both sorghum and soybean. An alternate year rotation resulted in yield advantages over monocropping. The highest yields for both sorghum and soybean were attained on sandy loam soil. Insecticide or nematicide treatment at planting resulted in little positive yield responses for either crop grown in rotation or monocropped.

Disease severity was assessed weekly from the middle of July through the first of October using a visual rating scale of percent leaf area exhibiting foliar symptoms of SDS. The disease ratings were used to calculate the absolute infection rate (dy/dt) for each cultivar at each rating time and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). In Lee 74, SDS progressed in two phases: an initial rapid increase in disease to about 35% leaf area affected and a slower increase after that point. This two-phase disease progress curve was fit by a segmented model using two exponential equations. The fits of these equations were highly significant (P 1%/day or, if lower than 1%/day, the highest dy/dt attained). DAP and dy/dt were significantly (P < 0.0001) related to AUDPC (R = -0.58 and R = 0.38, respectively). Cultivars susceptible to race 6 of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, the predominate race in the field, developed SDS 10 days earlier and had significantly higher levels of disease than cultivars resistant to race 6 of SCN. The earliest increases in SDS occurred between 71 and 77 DAP in 1986, 69 and 74 DAP in 1987, and 75 and 83 DAP in 1988 for most MGs. Accumulated heat for these periods was 910-942, 852-916, and 857-963 degree-days in 1986, 1987, and 1988, respectively. In 1987, three cultivars in MG VII and VIII had large increases 52 DAP after 608 degree-days. In general, however, disease increased at the same time across MGs, but at no specific reproductive stage.},

Bragg (nematode intolerant) and cv. Wright (moderately nematode tolerant) grown in the greenhouse in soils with low (35 mu g/g) and high (70 mu g/g) Phosphorus (P). Cultivar Wright grew better than cv. Bragg, showing a greater response to P and VAM, and was damaged less by SCN. These differences were not apparent, or were reversed, when the same cultivars were grown in growth chambers where lighting was sub-optimal. Cultivar Wright had a larger shoot:root ratio than cv. Bragg. This finding and the observed growth responses indicate that cv. Wright has a more efficient root system than cv. Bragg. This, we suggest, is the basis of both the greater VAM response observed in, and the greater nematode tolerance ascribed to, cv. Wright compared to cv. Bragg.},

Progeny response to SCN was characterized by Female Index (FI). Three morphological traits, 108 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), and 400 random amplified poll-morphic DNAs (RAPDs) were employed, The i locus for seed coat color showed highly significant association with resistance to race 3 SCN (R(2) = 0.25, P = 0.0001). Two independently inherited RFLP markers, pA 136 and pA635, (linkage groups A and C, of the USDA-ARS/ISU soybean RFLP map) and three RAPD markers, E01c (LG A), G15d (LG F), and S07a (LG A), explained 32.5 % of the total phenotypic variation for SCN response in F-2 progeny. Two-way ANOVA indicated significant interaction of i locus with pA136, pA635, S07a, and E01c (P= 0.0001) suggesting that a quantitatire trait locus (QTL) on LG A interacts with other QTLs for SCN resistance in the genome, The dominant QTL was localized 0.6 cM from i locus using MAPMAKER/QTL 1.1.

The benefit of planting the SCN-resistant cultivar Bell on a sandy soil in Wisconsin was evaluated in 1992 and 1993. A range of SCN population densities was achieved by planting 11 crops with varying degrees of susceptibility for 1 or 2 years before the evaluation. Averaged over nematode population densities, yield of 'Bell' was 30 to 43% greater than that of the susceptible cultivars, 'Corsoy 79' and 'BSR 101'. Counts of cysts collected the fall preceding soybean were more predictive of yield than counts taken at planting. Yields of all three cultivars were negatively related (P < 0.001) to cyst populations. Fewer (P < 0.01) eggs were produced on 'Bell' than on the susceptible cultivars. The annual (fall to fall) change in cyst population densities was dependent on initial nematode density for all cultivars in 1992 and for the susceptible cultivars in 1993. Yield reductions induced by the SCN under the conditions of this study indicate that planting a SCN-resistant cultivar in Wisconsin can be beneficial if any cysts are detected.},

The experiment was a 2 X 4 factorial, comparing no-till vs. conventional tillage practices in four cropping patterns (continuous soybean, a 1-yr rotation of corn and soybean, a rotation of 2 yr of corn followed by soybean, and a corn-wheat/soybean double-cropping system). Treatments were arranged so that each combination occurred every year after 1986. Soybean after 1 yr of corn had higher yields (P = 0.0001) than soybean after soybean. Two years of corn between soybean crops resulted in soybean yields higher than those after 1 yr of corn in only 2 out of 6 yr. The yields of soybean in the corn, wheat/soybean double-cropping system, however, were generally similar to monoculture soybean. No-till practices had positive or no effects on soybean yield early in the study, but yields of no-till soybean were lower (P = 0.01) than conventionally tilled soybean after several years because weed pressure was greater in no-till plots. Population densities of H. glycines were greater (P < 0.10) in conventionally tilled plots than in no-till plots in 1988 and 1990-1992. Numbers of H. glycines fluctuated in an unpredictable manner from year to year, possibly because of unidentified biological control agents or excessive moisture in certain years. H. glycines population densities declined in a predictable manner when a nonhost was planted.},

Soybean entries (26 in 1986 and 12 in 1988) in maturity groups 5-8 were either susceptible to SCN (S3S14) or resistant to race 3 (R3S14), or resistant to races 3 and 14 (R3R14). Vegetative growth was not visually affected. However, the ratio of seed yields for R3R14:R3S14:S3S14 was 100:52:37 in 1986 and for R3R14:R3S14 was 100:60 in 1988. In 1986, female SCN (root system)(-1), 47 days after planting, were 65 for S3S14. Mean yields were greater, and numbers of SCN female on roots were less, for R3R14 genotypes (P less than or equal to 0.05). Soil populations of SCN after harvest were negatively related to yield. Juveniles and mature females (numbers 100 cm(-3) soil), respectively, averaged 32 and 56 for R3R14 genotypes and 167 and 232 for R3S14 and S3S14 genotypes.

In each year, cyst densities at soybean planting were unaffected by the presence of residue from a prior winter wheat crop; however, harvest population densities were lower in plots with wheat residue compared with those without residue. Across residue treatments, tillage had no effect on harvest densities of cysts in any year. Differences in egg densities, determined only in 1992, were similar to differences detected in cyst densities for both residue and tillage. Minimum-tillage of wheat residue significantly reduced the ''residue effect'' in 1990 and 1991; however, plots with wheat residue had fewer cysts at harvest than plots without residue in both years regardless of tillage method.

Rhizosphere leachates from corn plants aged 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 days growing in sandy field soil stimulated emergence of J2 from cysts. Similar numbers of J2 emerged from cysts regardless of whether the source of cysts was field microplot cultures, greenhouse cultures, or growth chamber cultures.

Numbers of females developing on roots of inoculated seedlings were assigned to phenotype cells (resistant, susceptible, or segregating) using Ward's minimum variance cluster analysis. The ratio obtained from screening 220 F-3 soybean families was not significantly different from a 1:8:7 (resistant:segregating:susceptible) ratio, suggesting a two-gene system for resistance. The ratio obtained from screening 183 F-2 plants was not significantly different from a 3:13 (resistant:susceptible) ratio, indicating both a dominant (Rhg) and a recessive (rhg) resistance gene.},

	Abstract = {Transcription of genes encoding several enzymes and the activity of some of these enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to synthesis of chemical and physical barriers for defense of plants against root pathogens was estimated in susceptible and resistant soybean infected with Heterodera glycines race 3 or with Meloidogyne incognita race 3. Transcription of genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and the activity of this enzyme increased in resistant, but not susceptible, soybean cultivars after nematode infection. Likewise, transcription of the gene encoding 4-coumaryl CoA ligase and activity of this enzyme were enhanced in resistant, but not susceptible, soybean cultivars after nematode infection. Activity of PAL decreased in susceptible soybean after H. glycines or M. incognita infection. Transcription of enzymes later in the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to glyceollin synthesis increased in both resistant and susceptible soybean in response to nematode infection; the increase was greater in resistant cultivars. These results suggest possible reasons for the rapid induction of glyceollin synthesis immediately after infection of resistant soybean cultivars with H. glycines or M. incognita and the failure of this response in infected, susceptible soybean cultivars. Nematode infection had no effect on the activity of enzymes in the branch of the pathway leading to lignin synthesis.},

Glycine max was grown alone (1 plant/experimental unit), in intraspecific competition (2 plants/experimental unit), in interspecific competition with C. album, and in presence or absence of H. glycines. No significant effects of H. glycines and C. album on G. max growth were observed 14 days after planting. By 42 days after planting, both H. glycines and C. album had a negative (P = 0.05) influence on the growth of G. max. Relative crowding coefficients for G. max were lower and deviated (P = 0.05 and P = 0.001) from 1.0 in the presence of H. glycines, compared to that of C. album and early emerged C. album in the absence of the nematode, respectively. Glycine max, therefore, became less competitive than C. album. There was a trend that the presence of H. glycines decreased the competitiveness of G. max on measures of the aggressivity and relative mixture response. Heterodera glycines decreased the aggressivity of G. max (ca. 150-350%) and increased the relative effects of intraspecific interference on G. max (ca. 10-50%) and interspecific interference (ca. 60-350%) after 42 days of plant growth, compared with plants grown in the absence of H. glycines. No H. glycines x C. album interactions were detected. Observations showed that H. glycines and early emerged C. album inhibited the growth of G. max 5-13%, as measured by plant dry weight.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is a major pest of soybeans (Glycine max L. Merrill) in the central and southern United States. Soybean cyst nematode causes stunted top growth, root pruning and symptoms of mineral element deficiency in soybeans. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of two selections of SCN (I selected on PI209332 and IV selected on PI 89772) on macronutrient uptake, translocation, and tissue concentrations of soybean and to determine the elemental composition of cysts isolated from roots. Soybeans were grown in plastic tubes in the greenhouse where the middle one-third of the Hedge fine sand (Typic Udipsamment) contained 0, 25,000, or 50,000 SCN eggs. After 35 days, plants were harvested and tissue nutrient element concentrations were determined. Plants infested with both SCN selections were smaller and had much less root volume than controls. Dry weight of each plant tissue decreased as SCN population was increased. Root concentration of potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) was decreased, whereas root calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were increased with SCN treatments. Leaf Mg and Ca concentrations increased with SCN treatment. Magnesium uptake per unit root volume was decreased, but Mg translocation (% of total plant content in aerial portion) was increased with SCN treatment. Calcium uptake per unit of root volume was increased, but translocation was unchanged by SCN treatment. The Ca and P concentration of cysts isolated from the soybean roots was high. This high concentration of Ca in cysts is interesting based on the greater root Ca concentration and uptake per unit of root volume in SCN infested plants. Since total uptake and root concentrations of both K and Mg were decreased by SCN treatment, infested soybeans might require very high levels of K and Mg fertilization. These results indicate that K and Mg fertility should be followed closely in SCM-infested soybean fields.},

Pathotype Ha(22) selected as a feeding site the stelar parenchyma cells of wheat roots, which responded with extensive hypertrophy, increase in cellular organelles and formation of elaborate ingrowths of the cell walls adjacent to xylem tracheal elements as seen in a 5 day-old syncytium. On the same host, pathotype Ha(71) fed upon xylem parenchyma cells that reacted early (24 h) with callose-like and osmiophilic granule deposits on their walls, leading to the degradation of the induced syncytium within 5 days. Feeding of both pathotypes on oat roots induced a hypersensitive host reaction, characterized by extensive necrosis of the endodermis and pericycle. Pathotype Ha(22) induced small syncytia in the stele where cellular response was expressed through involution of the cytoplasmic content, indicating a lack of nutrients from plant to nematode.

Crosses involving PI 437654, which is resistant to all races of cyst nematodes with other sources of resistance (Peking, PI 88788, and PI 90763) indicated that resistance to race 3 was controlled by 4 genes, 2 of which were dominant resistance genes and the other 2 were recessive resistance genes. For race 5, a four gene model with 2 recessive and 2 dominant resistance genes in epistasis has been proposed. For race 14, the results suggested a three gene model with one dominant and 2 recessive alleles. Several other plant introductions have been isolated which have different genes conditioning resistance. Most of the currently grown soyabean varieties derived resistance from Peking and/or PI 88788. Resistance to SCN in these soyabean varieties has broken down because of the emergence of several new races and populations of SCN. The use of PI 437654 or Hartwig and other plant introductions with different genes for resistance will broaden genetic diversity and stabilize yield.},

The effect of temperature on reproduction was quadratic with the three races producing significantly greater numbers of cysts at 26 C; however, reproduction on resistant genotypes remained at a low level. Higher numbers of females matured at the soil pH levels of 6.5 and 7.5 than at pH 5.5.

	Abstract = {Adequate separation of effects of possible multiple linked quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on mapping QTLs is the key to increasing the precision of QTL mapping. A new method of QTL mapping is proposed and analyzed in this paper by combining interval mapping with multiple regression. The basis of the proposed method is an interval test in which the test statistic on a marker interval is made to be unaffected by QTLs located outside a defined interval. This is achieved by fitting other genetic markers in the statistical model as a control when performing interval mapping. Compared with the current QTL mapping method (i.e., the interval mapping method which uses a pair or two pairs of markers for mapping QTLs), this method has several advantages. (1) By confining the test to one region at a time, it reduces a multiple dimensional search problem (for multiple QTLs) to a one dimensional search problem. (2) By conditioning linked markers in the test, the sensitivity of the test statistic to the position of individual QTLs is increased, and the precision of QTL mapping can be improved. (3) By selectively and simultaneously using other markers in the analysis, the efficiency of QTL mapping can be also improved. The behavior of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and appropriate critical value of the test statistic for an overall test in a genome are discussed and analyzed. A simulation study of QTL mapping is also presented which illustrates the utility, properties, advantages and disadvantages of the method.},

Ten soybean cultivars from Maturity Groups III-V with differential susceptibility to H. glycines were treated with the fungicide benomyl to suppress colonization by naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungi and compared with untreated control plots. In H. glycines-infested soil, susceptible cultivars exhibited 39% lower yields, 28% lower colonization by mycorrhizal fungi, and an eightfold increase in colonization by the charcoal rot fungus, Macrophomina phaseolina, compared with resistant cultivars. In the absence of the nematode, susceptible cultivars exhibited 10% lower yields than resistant cultivars, root colonization of resistant vs. susceptible soybean by mycorrhizal fungi varied with sampling date, and there were no differences in colonization by M. phaseolina between resistant and susceptible cultivars. Benomyl application resulted in 19% greater root growth and 9% higher seed yields in H. glycines-infested soil, but did not affect soybean growth and yield in the absence of the nematode. Colonization of soybean roots by mycorrhizal fungi was negatively correlated with H. glycines population densities due to nematode antagonism to the mycorrhizal fungi rather than suppression of nematode populations. Soybean yields were a function of the pathogenic effects of H. glycines and M. phaseolina, and, to a lesser degree, the stimulatory effects of mycorrhizal fungi.},

	Abstract = {In 1992, a detection survey for Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode) was conducted in 16 counties in Michigan. The nematode was detected in 12 counties, with absolute frequencies ranging from 6 to 100%. A total of 149 samples was collected, and 53% were infested with H. glycines. Eighty-four growers participated in the survey, and 38 had samples collected from more than one field. Of the 38 growers, 42% had all samples positive for H. glycines, 18% had some positive and negative fields, and 39% had all negative. A risk index was developed to quantify three types of risks: short-term, long-term, and border risk from neighboring counties. Soybean yield was regressed on H. glycines population density and number of years of soybean. Thirty-one percent of the variability in soybean yields was explained by H. glycines cyst population densities. Total number of years in soybean over the last 20 year period explained 19% of the variability in yields. In addition, H. glycines frequencies and population densities were inversely related to Pratylenchus spp. frequencies and population densities.},

Symptoms of sudden death syndrome occurred on plants in soil containing F. solani or F. solani plus H. glycines. Signs (macroconidia) sometimes occurred on symptomatic roots. Fusarium solani was reisolated from symptomatic plants but not from asymptomatic ones. Histological data further confirmed F. solani as the causal agent and documented the presence of F. solani chlamydospores in infected roots and cysts. Fusarium solani was not isolated from surface-disinfested seeds of infected plants. Irrigation increased disease incidence and severity. Heterodera glycines was not necessary for infection of plants by F. solani; however, when combined with F. solani, leaf symptoms occurred earlier and were more severe. Inoculation with F. solani plus H. glycines increased the incidence of tip dieback of pods, a disorder of uncertain cause. Fusarium solani was isolated in high frequency from roots of symptomatic plants sampled in the South and Midwest. However, F. solani form B was the most common isolate from roots. A significant positive correlation occurred between incidence of the two F. solani forms in roots of symptomatic plants.},

	Abstract = {Studies of the effects of nematodes on the growth and physiology of parasitized plants are usually concerned with mineral nutrition in relation to water intake, photosynthesis, respiration and its associated biosynthesis. Other studies at the interface between the biology of nematodes and their parasitic impact, are concerned with mechanisms of attraction by root exudates. Nitrogen absorption which relies on symbiotic associations with plants, can also be disturbed by plant parasitic nematodes. Although the accumulated knowledge to date is sparse, and the physiological mechanisms examined are numerous, the levels of effects of nematodes on the biology of plants are diverse and are probably related. There are numerous papers on the mechanisms of defence of plants against parasitic nematodes but reviews are scarce. The intention of this bibliographical review is to survey the research done in the latter field, but also to structure the acquired knowledge in order to find a more general principle. This analysis describes the reactions of the hormonal metabolism, putting into place regulation mechanisms through auxins, cytokinins and ethylene, and of the phenolic pathway which produces chemicals i) directly toxic to the nematodes (e.g. phytoalexins), ii) that regulate defence reactions (monophenols-polyphenols balance), iii) that modify tissue development (e.g. lignins). These two branches of metabolism are dependent on enzymatic regulation (peroxydases, polyphenol oxydases, ammonia-lyases) in response to penetration and migration of nematodes in roots; such metabolic activity defines the degree of resistance of plants to nematodes.},

	Abstract = {Sensitive assays capable of detecting proteinases in single females of the phytoparasite Globodera pallida have been developed and used to define the proteinase activity of young adult females. Digestion of the large subunit of the plant protein Rubisco established a pH optimum for the proteinase activity at pH 5.7. The activity was inhibited by the cysteine proteinase inhibitors p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PMBA) and p-chloromercurisulphonic acid (PMSA) and stimulated by both cysteine and dithiothreitol (DTT). It was moderately reduced by L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane (E64) but not by specific inhibitors of serine, aspartate or metallo-proteinases. The activity separated into 3 bands on a non-denaturing gel but only 1 proteinase of 62 kDa was recovered following a combination of anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography using PMBA. The effect of inhibitors was similar to that reported previously for some of the cysteine proteinase activity recovered from Caenorhabditis elegans but is apparently not that for which the corresponding gene has been cloned in this nematode and Haemonchus contortus. The proteinase may have a major role in digestion of dietary protein and so offers an eliciting target for future control of this important plant-parasitic nematode.},

We analyzed testcross progeny from this cross (Rpl-C/Rpl-J) and a related cross (Rpl-F/Rpl-J) to identify noncrossover type derivatives, to estimate their frequency, and to determine the mechanism by which they arise. Testcross progeny were screened sequentially with two different rust isolates to assay each gene individually. Both susceptible noncrossover types and those with the combined resistance of each parent were identified in approximately equal frequencies. Patterns of recombination indicated that the noncrossover type derivatives arose by gene conversion as opposed to mutation or intrachromosomal crossing-over.

DNA markers, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), can be used to identify loci associated with complex genetic characters, including SCN resistance. To uncover these associations, 56 F-2 lines from a cross between a susceptible (M83-15) and a resistant (M85-1430) soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] inbred line were mapped for DNA marker polymorphisms. F-3 lines derived from these F-2 individuals were assayed for SCN disease response in the greenhouse to a field isolate of SCN from Minnesota that tested as Race 3. The F-2 genotypic classes for each of 43 DNA markers were then contrasted with SCN disease response to identify marker loci associated with SCN resistance. Two unlinked RFLP markers, pA85 and pB32, were found to be significantly associated with SCN disease response, together ac counting for 51.7% of total phenotypic variation. Based on RFLP analysis, individual F-2:3 lines that retained either one or both resistance loci were identified. Lines that possess both resistance loci could be valuable in developing resistant soybean lines free of linkage drag, while lines that have just one of the resistance loci may be useful as single-gene differentials for SCN race determination.},

Resultant low densities of encysted eggs, which are highly aggregated, probably prevented detection of eggs in some plots. No soybean cyst nematode was detected in uninfested plots at planting, although some contamination was noted at harvest. This method may be appropriate for establishing soybean cyst nematode population densities for some small-plot research.},

Herbicide stress was assessed by leaf stomatal conductance and visible foliar injury. Herbicides reduced conductance and caused visible injury each year, and Limited growth (plant height, leaf area, Fled number, and drg weight of leaf, pod, and stem plus petiole) in 1990 and 1991. Likewise, defoliation reduced leaf area each S-ear, but reduced growth (plant height and leaf dry weight) in 1990 and 1991 only. Uncontrolled environmental factors probably confounded growth responses; in 1989. Although no herbicide x defoliation effects on growth were found, defoliation caused greater reductions in canopy quantity and quality for herbicide-injured plants in 1990 and 1991. Targeted stress from SCN was achieved in 1990 and interaction with herbicides decreased conductance, increased visible herbicide injury and reduced leaf area, plant height, pod number, and pod dry weight. These data support the potential for stresses from SCN and acifluorfen plus bentazon to cause more-than-additive reductions in soybean growth.},

Herbicides were applied at V6 soybean development, while green cloverworm feeding was simulated during R2 to R4 soybean development. Plot yield and yield components (pods per plant, seeds per pod, and weight per seed) were determined. Herbicide injury and defoliation independently reduced yield in 1990 and 1991. Yield reductions from defoliation were attributed to fewer pods per plant, while herbicide injury decreased pods per plant (1990) and weight per seed (1990 and 1991). Moreover, herbicide injury and defoliation interacted over 1990 and 1991 to decrease yield. Although stress from soybean cyst nematode alone never affected yield, interactions with herbicides and with defoliation reduced yield in 1990. No treatment effects on yield were found in 1989, probably due to uncontrolled environmental factors. Because of the 2-yr herbicides x defoliation effect, lower economic injury levels for green cloverworm were developed for soybean treated with acifluorfen plus bentazon. To account for potential interactions involving soybean cyst nematode, growers will be advised to consider adjusting weed and insect management strategies for soybean fields infested with soybean cyst nematode.},

To best utilize sources of genetic resistance to SCN, this variation needs to be characterized. Fifty-eight populations of the SCN were collected from 10 major soybean producing states. These populations were compared for infraspecific variation in parasitic potential on soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] genotypes 'Peking', 'Pickett', Plant Introduction (PI) 88788, PI 90763, and 'Lee 68'. Race structure, genes for parasitism (capability of a nematode population to produce at least one cyst on a resistant genotype), and levels of parasitism (percentage of cysts that developed on resistant genotypes compared with the susceptible cultivar Lee 68) were assessed. Race 3 was present in 45% of locations; it was the most widespread population. Race 6 was present in 19% of the locations. Frequency of occurrence of other races (Races 1, 2, 5, 9, and 14) ranged between 3 and 9%. On the basis of reproduction on genotypes, 83% of the populations tested had genes to parasitize Pickett. All populations from Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, and South Carolina produced cysts on this genotype. Average level of parasitism was greatest on Pickett and lowest on PI 90763; 91% of SCN populations tested had <10% level of parasitism on PI 90763. The SCN gene frequencies demonstrated that nematode populations with predominant genes for parasitism on Pickett and Lee 68 were widespread especially in the southern soybean producing states in the USA. Cultivation of varieties with resistance derived from Peking and Pickett in these regions should not be very effective. For management of SCN-caused yield losses, cultivation of soybean varieties with resistance derived from PI 90763, PI 88788, and PI 437654 should be encouraged.},

Eggs were analyzed and sorted according forward angle and 90-degrees light scatter, flow cytometric parameters that are relative measures of object size and granularity, respectively. Mature eggs containing vermiform juveniles were less granular and slightly larger than eggs in earlier stages of embryogeny, allowing for separation of mature eggs from immature eggs. The effectiveness of flow cytometric sorting was evaluated by comparing the developmental stages of subpopulations of unsorted and sorted eggs. Of a subpopulation of unsorted eggs, 62% contained vermiform juveniles, whereas 85 to 95% of sorted subpopulations of larger, less granular eggs contained vermiform juveniles. Suspending H. glycines eggs in 0.1% xanthan gum or 59% sucrose for flow cytometric analysis had no effect on subsequent egg hatch in vitro. This technique is an efficient and effective means to collect large, relatively homogeneous quantities of H. glycines eggs in early of late embyogeny, and would likely be useful for analyzing and sorting eggs of other nematode species for use in developmental, genetic, or physiological research, of for identification and collection of parasitized eggs.},

The MG V susceptible cultivar yielded better than earlier-maturing susceptible cultivars even when yields of resistant cultivars were similar across maturity groups.

Harvest densities of H. glycines were lower for late-planted than for early-planted susceptible soybeans in 1990; however, nematode population increase was more rapid on roots of late-planted soybeans in 1991.

Plants were defoliated over a 2-week period beginning 5 weeks after seedlings were transplanted. Four groups of plants were infested with nematodes (5,000 eggs/pot) at 2-week intervals to allow harvesting of plants at 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks postdefoliation (WPD). Plants in each group were harvested 4 weeks after nematode infestation. Root and nodule weights of defoliated plants were suppressed at 0 WPD, but differences were not detectable at 2, 4, and 6 WPD. Population densities of M. incognita were similar on defoliated and control plants at 0 WPD but were greater on defoliated plants at 4 and 6 WPD. Percentage hatching of eggs produced on the latter plants also was higher. Effects of insect-induced defoliation on development of M. incognita remained detectable even after soybean plant growth apparently returned to normal.},

	Abstract = {Sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a soilborne disease of increasing importance in high-yield environments. This study was conducted to determine which combinations of soil fertility parameters and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinoe) (SCN) second stage juvenile (J2) population levels were associated with SDS disease severity. Also, the effect of SDS disease severity on leaf nutrient content and on soybean yield and seed germination were determined. These studies were conducted at the Pine Tree Station, in Colt, on a Crowley silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Albaqualfs) over 3 yr with the soybean cultivar Lee 74. Soil factors associated with SDS were increased levels of soil available P, electrical conductivity (soluble salts), organic matter, and exchangeable Na, Ca, and Mg. Decreased levels of leaf N, Mg, Cu, and Mn and increased levels of leaf Ca were related to increased levels of SDS severity. Sudden death syndrome severity was negatively correlated with yield in 2 of 3 yr and with seed quality in 1 of 2 yr. Soybean cyst nematode second stage juvenile population density decreased as SDS severity increased in the study relating soil and leaf nutrient levels fo SDS. This may reflect a decrease in the ability of a diseased root system to support nematode reproduction. In the yield studies, however, SCN was negatively correlated to yield and positively correlated to SDS in 1 of 2 yr. Soybeans grown in high production environments of increased soil fertility and irrigation appear to be more susceptible to SDS. Sudden death syndrome affects yields by a reduction in seed size and number and may, under the proper environmental conditions, affect seed germination. The role of SCN in SDS is still unclear.},

	Abstract = {It is often assumed that genetic diversity contributes to reduced disease incidence in natural plant populations. However, little is known about the genetic structure of natural populations affected by disease. Here I present data from three apomictic (asexual) populations of Arabis holboellii infected by the rusts Puccinia monoica and P. thlaspeos. An average of 300 host individuals per population were genotyped (using seven variable allozyme loci) and scored for disease presence. Arabis holboellii populations are genetically diverse; the number of clones detected per population ranged from 6 to 27. There was substantial variation in frequency of host clones within and among sites, and significant variation among clones in susceptibility to the different rusts. Contrary to predictions based on frequency-dependent selection theory there was not a consistent positive relationship between clone frequency and disease incidence within any of the populations (Spearman's r = -0.096, P > 0.5). In addition, clonally diverse populations did not necessarily have decreased disease incidence. The population with the lowest overall (both pathogens combined) disease incidence (7.5 +/- 1.9%) had the smallest number of clones (6), the lowest spatial variability, and the highest Arabis density. By comparison, another population had 22 clones, high spatial variability, low Arabis density and significantly more disease overall (16.8 +/- 2.7%). Although this study does not eliminate the possibility of frequency-dependent pathogen attack in these populations, the results suggest that it is likely to be weak or intermittent.},

	Abstract = {The efficacy of furfural (2-furfuraldehyde) as a nematicide was studied in greenhouse and microplot experiments. Mixing furfural with soil at rates of 0.1-1.0 ml/kg prior to transferring soil to greenhouse pots suppressed initial populations of Meloidogyne arenaria and Pratylenchus brachyurus. The number of root galls induced by Meloidogyne arenaria in 'Summer Crookneck' squash (Cucurbita pepo) after 8 weeks was reduced proportionately to the rate of furfural applied to the soil before planting. Similar results were obtained for M. incognita, Heterodera glycines, and other species when soybean (Glycine max) was used as a host. Furfural also was effective as a nematicide when its vapor was allowed to diffuse through a soil column. In microplots, preplant injection of furfural was simulated by pouring it into a 25-cm-deep trench that was immediately covered with soil. When furfural was applied to microplots at rates of 53-159 ml/m2 soil, initial populations of M. arenaria and P. minor were reduced and yields of 'Clemson Spineless' okra (Hibiscus esculentum) were increased. No further yield increases were obtained at higher rates. Results indicate that furfural could have practical applications in the control of phytoparasitic nematodes.},

Advantages of this approach include the use of partially effective strategies and protection of highly effective ones vulnerable from nematode adaptation or environmental risk. Strategies can be combined sequentially from season to season or applied simultaneously. Programs that have several strategies available but that are limited in the true integration of control components are used as examples of current management procedures and the potential for their improvement. These include potato cyst nematodes in northern Europe, soybean cyst nematode in North Carolina, and root-knot nematodes on vegetable and field crops in California. A simplified model of the impact of component strategies on the nematode damage function indicates the potential for combining control measures with different efficacies to give acceptable nematode population reduction and crop protection. The likelihood for additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects from combining strategies is considered with respect to the biological target and component compatibility.},

A greenhouse bioassay (free), egg count ($10/sample), and race determination test ($25) were conducted by request on soil samples submitted to the lab. Each test was offered for a specific purpose: the bioassay for fields not known to be infested; the egg count for population monitoring in fields with known infestations; and the race test for fields with a history of resistant cultivars. Of 818 samples submitted for bioassay on a H. glycines-susceptible soybean cultivar, 13 (1.6%) contained brown cysts but no white females, and 364 (45%) contained white females after 35 days in the greenhouse. Of 6,193 egg counts, 39% were either free of H. glycines or contained fewer than 500 eggs/250 cm(3) soil, the action threshold for Missouri. The remaining 61% ranged from 500-400,000 eggs/250 cm(3) soil (mean = 10,617). Eleven races were detected, with races 3 (45%) and 1 (23%) the most common. The data show that H. glycines is widespread in Missouri (with confirmed infestations in 80 of 114 counties), that most infested fields have population densities above the action threshold, and that there is considerable genetic diversity among H. glycines field populations.},

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is a serious pest of soybean [(Glycine mar (L.) Merr.]. Most genetic studies of resistance in soybean to SCN have used qualitative models, although continuous distributions of phenotypes from zero to many cysts have been observed. We investigated the mode of inheritance for resistance to Race 3 of SCN by weighted least squares regression analysis of generation means for genetic models having additive and dominance parameters. Reaction to SCN was determined by counting the white females present on plant roots 30 d after inoculation. Four crosses, including one reciprocal, were made between resistant and susceptible genotypes. The ancestry of the resistant genotypes ('A20', 'Jack', and 'Cordell') traces to different sources of SCN resistance. Six generation means (P-1, P-2, F-1, F-2, BCP1, and BCP2) in three of the crosses, and four in one (P-1, P-2, F-1, F-2), were used to estimate the genetic effects contained in the means. The data were transformed for analysis because they were not normally distributed. The results indicated that an additive genetic model was sufficient to explain most of the genetic variation for resistance to Race 3 in each cross. Analysis of the pooled data from all crosses, however, indicated the presence of dominance effects as well. Recovery of parental phenotypes in the F,and backcross populations indicated that no more than four genes were involved in the inheritance of the trait. Estimates for broad sense heritabilities on single plant basis ranged from 0.48 to 0.81. The relatively high heritability and additive genetic control indicate that breeders should be able to select genotypes with an intermediate level of resistance.},

Population densities of this nematode were consistently greater (P = 0.05) for an MG VII cultivar than an MG V cultivar. Planting date had variable effects on final population density of H. glycines: early planting resulted in the highest nematode numbers in some years, whereas late planting was associated with significantly greater (P= 0.05) population densities in other years. Yields were higher (P = 0.01) when soybean followed 1 or 2 yr of nonhosts than in monoculture. Yields of an MG V cultivar grown in succession with an MG V cultivar were greater than those of an MG VII cultivar that followed an MG VII cultivar, either in monoculture or in a 1-yr rotation with a nonhost. The higher yield of the earlier-maturing MG V cultivar was the result of low equilibrium densities of H. glycines associated with a shorter growing season. Late planting (June) generally resulted in lower soybean yield than early (May) planting. Yield of an MG V cultivar planted late was generally equivalent to that of an MG VII cultivar planted in May when H. glycines was at damaging levels.},

Leaf water potential (psi1) and soil oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) were significantly affected by psi(s) (P < 0.01) after 16 d of exposure to SCN. In the infested treatments psi1 was reduced at a more rapid rate with decreasing psi(s) than in the non-inoculated controls. The increase in SCN penetration of the soybean root system corresponded positively to the increase in soil ODR and corresponding decrease in psi(s). Recovery of SCN from the soil decreased with a decrease in psi(s). A mechanistic, nonlinear mathematical model was used to describe the relationship between psi(s) and SCN penetration of soybean roots. A quadratic regression model was used to describe the relationship between psi(s) and SCN recovery from the soil.},

	Abstract = {The interval mapping method is widely used for the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in segregating generations derived from crosses between inbred lines. The efficiency of detecting and the accuracy of mapping multiple QTLs by using genetic markers are much increased by employing multiple QTL models instead of the single QTL models (and no QTL models) used in interval mapping. However, the computational work involved with multiple QTL models is considerable when the number of QTLs is large. In this paper it is proposed to combine multiple linear regression methods with conventional interval mapping. This is achieved by fitting one QTL at a time in a given interval and simultaneously using (part of) the markers as cofactors to eliminate the effects of additional QTLs. It is shown that the proposed method combines the easy computation of the single QTL interval mapping method with much of the efficiency and accuracy of multiple QTL models.},

Merr.] yield significantly. This study compared the yields of susceptible ('Essex'), moderately susceptible ('Cordell'), and moderately resistant ('A5474' or LA5403') Maturity Group V soybean at different levels of SCN (Race 14) infestation in a greenhouse. Level of initial infestation of SCN was 0, 200, and 600 cysts L(-1) in the top 15 cm depth of greenhouse pots. Seed yield of all cultivars declined with increasing level of infestation in 1990, but in 1992, seed yield of all cultivars declined significantly only between the 0 and 200 cysts L(-1) level. Yields of Essex and Cordell were essentially equal within all infestation levels, while yields of A5474 and A5403 were greater than those of Essex and Cordell in the infested treatments. Yield declines between the 0 and 200 cysts L(-1) treatments averaged 55% for Essex, 50% for Cordell, and 20% for A5474 and A5403. Seed yield was significantly correlated with number of pods and number of seed in both years, but not with weight of seeds or seeds per pod. These results indicate that SCN will reduce yield of moderately resistant and moderately susceptible cultivars dissimilarly. These results also indicate that the classification of cultivars for resistance to SCN reproduction is not necessarily indicative of the yield potential of these cultivars in the presence of SCN Race 14.},

Resistance to SCN in Hartwig and its donor parent, PI 437654, was studied from observations of the developmental stages of the nematode in the plant roots and compared with the development in susceptible 'Essex'. Soybean seedlings (emerging roots) were exposed to a wild population of SCN for 8 h and transferred to hydroponics. Adult males and females were extracted and the number of immature juveniles in the roots was recorded from stained roots. A greater number of juveniles of SCN penetrated the roots of Hartwig than roots of PI 437654 or Essex. Several immature juveniles were observed in the roots of Hartwig and PI 437654; however, no mature females developed on either of these two lines. There were no immature juveniles in Essex. Many adult males developed in Hartwig and PI 437654. Complete resistance to female development operated in both Hartwig and PI 437654, whereas partial resistance to male development was observed in PI 437654. Hartwig soybean seems to attract more SCN juveniles, resulting in greater initial penetration than occurs in PI 437654 or Essex.},

Nematode population density was found to be clustered. Up to 91% of the eggs were parasitized by a sterile fungus. Principal component analysis with orthogonal VARIMAX rotation grouped 12 variables into five uncorrelated factors in 1988 and three in 1989. In 1988, the factor ''pH and Mg'' was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with cyst and egg population density. Also, the factor ''fine texture and Cu'' was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with egg population density. In 1989, the factor ''pH, Mg and Cu'' was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with levels of cysts and percentage of parasitized eggs, but not with total egg number. Across 2 years, factors containing soil pH and Mg were positively associated with cyst nematode population density. Copper appeared to be negatively associated with populations of H. glycines.},

	Abstract = {Eighteen populations, composed of four wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties that were originally mixed together at equal frequencies, were grown for one-to-three generations at two locations. In addition, pure stands of the four varieties were grown in each year. Populations were either exposed to two stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) races, protected from stripe rust, or exposed to alternating years of diseased and disease-free conditions. Regression of the logit of a variety's frequency versus generation number was used to calculate the relative fitness of each variety in each population. These analyses suggest that the relative fitnesses of the wheat varieties were affected by disease and geographic location and were constant over time. However, frequency-changes of varieties in the mixtures were negatively correlated with their planting frequencies (0.0001 < P < 0.085 in 14 out of 16 cases), suggesting that fitnesses were frequency-dependent in both the presence and absence of disease. We hypothesize that failure to detect frequency-dependence of fitness in the logit analyses was due to a limited number of generations and a limited range of initial variety frequencies. This is supported by data from longer-term studies in the literature that provide evidence for frequency-dependence of fitness in plant mixtures. Analyses of currently available field data suggest that stable equilibria may be a more likely outcome for mixtures of varieties that are more closely related and/or more uniformly adapted to the environment in which they are grown.},

Accumulation of cuticular exudates was correlated with the fibrillar and porous nature of the epicuticle, exocuticle, and endocuticle. The apparent source of the exudates was the hypodermis, where coalesced secretory vesicles were assembled by Golgi bodies and transferred to the inner surface of the apical membrane of the hypodermis. Products of the secretory vesicles were apparently released into a secretion accumulation zone at the base of the endocuticle by some mechanism and then extruded through and onto the cuticle surface. Golgi bodies occurred in large expanded regions of the hypodermis, especially in the hypodermal cords, where prominent nuclei and other cellular components were located. During ecdysis of the J2 cuticle and early stages of third-stage juvenile (J3) cuticle formation, fine reticulate material accumulated at the secretory-excretory pore. Concurrently, moderately electron-dense material occurred in the invaginated cephalic region and in the space extending between the molted J2 cuticle and the entire J3 body.},

In samples taken 18 hr after inoculation and beyond, subventral gland extensions of parasitic second- and third-stage juveniles contained small, electron-dense secretory granules. The subventral glands were also characterized by the presence of moderate to very large flocculate secretion bodies within a dense matrix of rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. The activity of the Golgi apparatus was directly related to the formation and accumulation of condensing vesicles that appeared to merge with each other to form the larger secretory granules occurring in the subventral glands of parasitic stages of the nematode. The large flocculate secretion bodies were observed as early as 10 hr after inoculation and contrasted with the dense cytoplasm of the subventral glands observed 6 days after inoculation.

The human and Caenorhabditis elegans genome-sequencing projects promise further techniques and results useful to applied nematology. Of course, biotechnology is not a panacea for nematological problems, but it provides many powerful tools that have potential use in applied biology and nematode management. The tools will facilitate research on a range of previously intractable problems in nematology, from identification of species and pathotypes to the development of resistant cultivars that have been inaccessible because of technical limitations. However, to those unfamiliar or not directly involved with the new technologies and their extensive terminology, the benefits of the advances in biotechnology may not be readily discerned. The sustainable agriculture of the future will require ecology-based management, and successful integrated nematode management will depend on combinations of control tactics to reduce nematode numbers. In this review we discuss how biotechnology may influence nematode management, define terminology relative to potential applications, and present current and future avenues of research in applied nematology, including species identification, race and pathotype identification, development of resistant cultivars, definition of nematode-host interactions, nematode population dynamics, establishment of optimal rotations, the ecology of biological control and development of useful biological control agents, and the design of novel nematicides.},

Hybridomas were formed by fusing myelomas with splenocytes derived from mice immunized with either infective juveniles or females of G. pallida. About 600 hybridoma lines were screened from the fusion involving the mouse immunized with juveniles. Two MAbs (LJMAb1 & 2) were identified with high reactivity toward second-stage juveniles but no reactivity with either potato roots or females of G. pallida. A total of 630 cell lines was screened from the corresponding fusion involving the spleen of a mouse receiving immunogens from adult female nematodes. One MAb (LFMAb1) was obtained with the required specificity against only adult female G. pallida. This work extends the application of monoclonal antibodies in nematology from valuable probes for research and species identification to recognition of developmental stages.

Compared to Lee 74, more (P = 0.05) females of H. glycines race 1 were extracted from PI 274420, PI 274423, and PI 317333; PI 86457 had more females of H. glycines race 2; and PI 86443, PI 86457, PI 261467, PI 274420, PI 274421, and PI 274423 had more females of H. glycines race 3. Similar numbers of females of H. glycines race 4 developed on all of the soybean lines and Lee 74. PI 27442 1, PI 274420, or PI 196159 could provide a more or equally susceptible host for H. glycines races 1, 2, 3, and 4 than Lee 74. One of these three lines could be substituted for Lee as the standard susceptible cultivar in the race determination test.},

	Abstract = {Nine soybean (Glycine max) cropping sequences were compared for 11 yr in a field infested with the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines. Continuous cropping sequences included six soybean lines resistant to race 3 (Bedford, Forrest, Nathan, Peking, D72-8927, and D75-10710) with varying levels of resistance to race 4 and a 70:30 Bedford/ Forrest (susceptible to this SCN population) blend. Two rotations, Bedford with corn (Zea mays) and Bedford with susceptible Forrest and Essex, were the other treatments. The most notable effect of continuous cropping of resistant soybean was the increased reproduction of the SCN population on resistant, Bedford relative to reproduction on susceptible Essex. The increase in the ability to reproduce on Bedford was less in the continuously planted blend treatment and rotation of Bedford with Forrest and Essex than with continuously planted Bedford. Yield of continuously cropped resistant Bedford was significantly less than that of Bedford in rotation with corn in only one of two treatments with this rotation when compared over the 11-yr period. Yield of Bedford in rotation with Forrest and Essex was not greater than that of continuously cropped Bedford. In most years, continuously cropped Bedford had higher yield than continuously cropped Forrest. Cyst population density did not increase over time in plots of continuously grown Bedford, which may explain the lack of yield suppression.},

	Abstract = {Plant-parasitic nematodes are obligate parasites, and planting cultivars that are highly resistant to these organisms places extensive selection pressure on the target species and affects nontarget nematodes as well. Problems encountered with long-term planting of cultivars resistant to nematodes include shifts in nematode races or species and the occurrence of multiple species of nematodes within the same field. These problems can be alleviated to some extent when crop management is used to lessen the selection pressure for change on the nematode populations. Race shifts within populations and possibly shifts between nematode species can be delayed by rotating susceptible cultivars and nonhost crops with resistant cultivars. Nematicides in conjunction with resistant cultivars may be used to limit damage by multiple species of nematodes. Some cultivars have resistance to multiple species of nematodes, but greatly increased research effort is needed in this area. More intensive plant breeding effort will be required to make nematode resistant cultivars competitive in quality and yield with more productive, susceptible cultivars.},

The juvenile stage 2 (J2) nematodes of H. schachtii migrate intracellularly with destructive stylet thrusts before establishing their permanent feeding site (syncytium) within the vascular cylinder. After the selection of the initial syncytial cell (ISC) they undergo a preparation period before they start feeding from the ISC. During all developmental stages feeding occurs in cycles, composed of three distinct phases. In contrast, the J2 of Meloidogyne incognita reach their permanent feeding site by intercellular migration, first towards the apex of the root, where they turn round, and move towards the differentiating vascular cylinder. A characteristic behavioral pattern, composed of continuous head and stylet movements, interspersed by periods of stylet-tip protrusion and metacorpal bulb pumping is maintained during all phases of parasitism, i.e., root invasion, intercellular migration and feeding from the giant-cells.},

With these probes we were also able to discriminate between geographical isolates. The results clearly indicate the existence of three geographical subgroups in the B. xylophilus species: the United States, Canada and Japan with a close relationship between the USA and Japanese isolates. This supports the hypothesis that the B. xylophilus isolate, which was introduced into Japan, originated from the USA.

Eggs from the field were collected in the spring and fall and assayed for ability to develop on Peking and PI 88788. Hatch of isolates overwintered in the microplots averaged 13% in May 1989 and 19% in 1990. No differences in hatch were detected among the isolates in 1989. Numbers of juveniles penetrating susceptible roots averaged less than 20% of the hatched eggs each year. An isolate of a biotype parasitic on susceptible soybeans and the resistant soybean PI 88788 penetrated roots more successfully than other biotypes. A second isolate from North Carolina, parasitic on susceptible soybeans, PI 88788, and the resistant soybean Peking experienced selection against development on Peking during two winters. Only 17% of the expected numbers of females developed on Peking from this isolate. In the microplot experiment, parasitism of PI 88788 and Peking had a selective disadvantage (selection coefficient) of s = 0.29 and 0.62 over all isolates, respectively. In the field experiment, the relative numbers of cysts on Peking and PI 88788 increased between the spring and fall on soybean, then decreased over the winter and under corn.

Seedlings inoculated with rhizobia were transplanted into pots of nematode egg-infested soil (one nematode species per pot) or noninfested soil. Three days later, plants and soil were exposed to simulated rain (2 cm in 1 h) adjusted to pH 5.3, 4.3, 3.3, or 2.3. After three rains per week for 8 wk, major effects on plants and nematodes (e.g., shoot dry weight and production of cyst nematode eggs suppressed by approximately 80 and 90%, respectively) occurred only after rains at pH 2.3 (relative to those exposed to rains at pH 5.3). Characteristics of polynomial dose-response relationships indicated that the effects of simulated acidic rain on plants and nematodes were nematode species-dependent; dose-response relationships for many dependent variables (plant biomasa, nodulation, disease symptoms, nematode reproduction measurements) versus rain pH differed between cyst nematodes and root-knot nematodes, but most dose-response characteristics for the two Meloidogyne spp. were similar. Acid deposition can influence nematode-plant interactions, but the acidity of simulated rain required to cause major changes exceeded that known in the United States.},

Olive pomace (OP) was added to the soil at rates of 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, and 20 g/kg soil. OP was applied alone or in combination with 0.1 and 0.2 g urea/kg soil. Twelve days after addition of the amendments, tomato seedlings were transplanted to pots containing treated soil and were allowed to grow for 45 days. OP without urea was toxic to the seedlings and had no effect on root galling caused by M. arenaria. The OP + urea treatments resulted in increased size and weight of the seedlings. OP at 4-6 g/kg soil in combination with the 0.2 g rate of urea suppressed root galling and resulted in the heaviest and healthiest looking seedlings. In other studies, the nematicidal activity of OP distillates was assessed in the laboratory and greenhouse. Fresh OP dispersed in aqueous H2SO4 solutions was refluxed for 4 hr at 120 C. The concentration of acid in the OP-H2SO4 mixture was varied from 12.5-75% (v/v) of standard concentrated H2SO4 (sp. gravity = 1.84). The digests were distilled under vacuum (-1/3 bar). The distillates were tested in vitro for activity against Pratylenchus vulnus. All distillates were toxic to the nematode. When the distillate obtained from refluxing a mixture of OP with 12.5% H2SO4 was added to soil (5-20 ml distillate/kg soil) in a greenhouse experiment, it significantly reduced populations of M. arenaria and Heterodera glycines at dosages > 10 ml/kg soil. Results indicate that OP can serve as raw material for preparation of soil amendments with nematicidal properties.},

Traditional nematode management is based on the use of crop rotations, resistant cultivars, nematicides, or combinations of these methods. For a crop like peanut (Arachis hypogaea), cultivars resistant to root-knot nematodes are not available. There are soybean (Glycine max) cultivars resistant to some of the species of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.); however, most fields have nematode infestations composed of mixtures of species. Research at Auburn has shown that tropical crops can be used effectively in rotation to manage nematode problems. Rotations with American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana), castor (Ricinus communis), hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsuta), partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata), sesame (Sesamum indicum), and velvetbean (Mucuna deeringiana) have resulted in good nematode control and increased yields of peanut and soybean. Some crops (castor, sesame) are considered 'active' in that they produce compounds that are nematicidal, whereas others (e.g. corn, sorghum) are simply non-host, that is, 'passive'.},

Custer, Bedford, PI 209332, PI 404166, PI 404198B, PI 437690, and PI 438496B were useful in describing variation in race 6 field isolates. Race 14 isolates were separated according to their response to soybean lines PI 404166, PI 404198B, PI 438489B, PI 438503A, and PI 89772. None of the additional hosts further separated race 9 isolates, The additional hosts used in this study are genetically stable in reaction to nematode and, therefore, may be useful in describing variability among SCN isolates. PI 437654 is recommended as a resistant control of race determination. We found soybean lines PI 437654, PI 438489B, PI 438503A, and PI 89772 resistant to all isolates of newly designated SCN races 6 and 9. Additional resistance to isolates of race 9 was found in PI 209332 and PI 404166. Soybean line PI 89772 has agronomically desirable traits and may be used as an alternate source of SCN resistance in breeding soybean cultivars.},

The F1, F2, and F3 plants from five different crosses among resistant (R) and susceptible (S) cultivars were evaluated for SCN resistance in the greenhouse. Individual plants were categorized as resistant or susceptible based on the index of parasitism. The chi-square test was used to determine goodness of fit between observed and expected ratios. The results indicated that SCN race 3 resistance was conditioned by one dominant and two recessive genes in each parent. Peking and PI90763 have all three resistance genes in common. Two genes, Rhg4 and rhg2, in both Peking and in PI90763 were also in PI88788. An additional dominant gene in PI88788 and a second recessive gene in Peking and in PI90763 provided non-allelic interaction.},

Iron deficiency chlorosis, brown stem rot, and Phytophthora rot cause soybean seed yield losses annually in Iowa and may occur in H. glycines-infested fields. Soybean cultivars with known reactions to each disease were chosen, and two plots of each cultivar were planted per replication-one treated with aldicarb for H. glycines control, and the other not treated. Cultivar reaction to other diseases had no effect on H. glycines final populations or soybean seed yields. Seed yields of H. glycines-susceptible cultivars were 5.7-35.8% lower than those of resistant cultivars in all environments and were affected by treatment with aldicarb in 1987 but not in 1986. Artificial infestations of H. glycines were established in microplots in a field in Story County (central Iowa) to determine damage thresholds. One resistant and one susceptible cultivar were planted following infestation with 0, 10, 50, 250, or 1,250 eggs per 100 cm3 of soil. In 1986 and 1987, the H. glycines density explained 92 and 54%, respectively, of the reduction in seed yields of the susceptible cultivar. The damage threshold was between 10 and 50 eggs, and yields were reduced 52 and 19% at the highest egg density in 1986 and 1987, respectively.},

Three fields, each with high densities of Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus, Pratylenchus, or Paratylenchus projectus, were planted in 1989 with six soybean cultivars, with plots of each cultivar either not treated or treated with 5.43 kg/ha aldicarb, to determine whether economically important relationships existed. In none of the sites were nematode densities affected by either aldicarb treatment or cultivar, nor were seed yields related to nematode densities; however, mean seed yield was significantly lower in the P. projectus site. In 1990, seed yield was negatively correlated (r = -0.34, P < 0.05) with P. projectus density at planting. Based on the present and previous studies, H. pseudorobustus and P. hexincisus do not appear to be of economic interest on soybean, but P. projectus probably deserves more study.},

Isolates from antagonistic plants were compared to soybean isolates for the frequency of antagonism to the root-knot (Meloidogyne incognita) and soybean cyst (Heterodera schachtii) nematodes in a disease assay with soybean. Bacterial isolates were identified using fatty acid analysis, and isolates which exhibited a significant reduction in incidence of soybean damage from both nematodes were characterized physiologically. The bacterial taxa associated with antagonistic plants were markedly different from soybean bacteria. Isolates from soybean were predominantly Bacillus spp., while those from antagonistic plants included more coryneform and Gram-negative genera. Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas gladioli were predominant among Gram-negative bacteria on antagonistic plants but were not isolated from soybean. Four to six times the number of bacteria from antagonistic plants, compared to soybean, significantly reduced disease incidence of both nematodes. No single pattern of physiological reactions was common among all these bacteria, suggesting that multiple mechanisms accounted for the observed biological control. The results suggest that rhizospheres of antagonistic plants may be useful sources of potential biological control agents for phytopathogenic nematodes.},

Numerous pores, apparently caused by fungal penetration, were found below the sclerotiumlike structures on the cyst cuticles. The cyst cuticles at the site of the sclerotiumlike structures appeared to have been dissolved. These results suggest that ARF18 penetrates the cyst cuticle enzymatically. The surface of diseased eggs was heavily furrowed. Hyphae of ARF18 have electron-transparent septa that contain simple pores associated with Woronin bodies.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of irrigation on number of SCN cysts and seed yield of three soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars that have varying levels of SCN resistance when grown in monoculture on SCN-infested Dundee silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic, Aeric Ochraqualf) that has a perched water table. Cultivars (all MaturitY Group V) were Forrest (resistant to SCN Race 3), A5474 (resistant to SCN Races 3 and 4), and Bay (susceptible to SCN). Bay was grown with and without nematicide applied after planting. Irrigation treatment was either with or without supplemental water during reproductive development of soybean. Neither seed yield nor number of SCN cysts at planting or harvest were significantly (P = 0.05) affected by irrigation on this soil. Application of nematicide to Bay plots reduced the number of SCN cysts at harvest, but did not significantly affect seed yield. Number of SCN cysts was lowest in A5474 plots, and seed yield of A5474 was highest in the second and third year of the study. Irrigation did not significantly interact with cultivar or nematicide to affect cyst number or seed yield. We conclude that irrigation during reproductive development of soybean did not affect (i) cultivar response to infection with SCN, (ii) the capability of SCN to maintain cysts on any cultivar, or (iii) the yield-limiting effect of SCN on susceptible cultivars. This suggests that SCN effects on soybean are more complex than simply restricting water uptake by roots.},

Roots of 3-day-old soybean were exposed to infective juveniles of H. glycines in sand for 8 hours followed by washing and transfer to hydroponic culture. The cotyledons and apical meristem were removed and plants were maintained under constant light, which resulted in a dwarfed plant system. After 15 or 20 days at 27 C, nematodes were rated for development. Emerged males were sieved from the culture water and females were counted directly from the roots. Nematodes remaining in the roots were rated for development after staining and clearing the tissues. The proportion of nematodes at each stage of development and the frequency of completed molts for each stage were calculated from these data. This technique showed that resistance to H. glycines was stage related and did not affect males and females equally in all resistant hosts. The resistance of plant introduction PI 209332 primarily affected development of third and fourth-stage juveniles; 'Pickett' mainly affected second and third-stage juveniles, whereas PI 89772 affected all stages.

To test the possibility that removal of the root meristem affected nematode development, a culture system using pruned soybeans was devised that permitted access to the roots without disturbing the plants. Treatments included removal of 2 mm of root tip at various times ranging from 24 hours before to 10 days after inoculation, or roots left intact. In each experiment, all roots were inoculated at the same time with equal numbers of freshly hatched second-stage juveniles of Heterodera glycines. No differences in nematode development were detected in plants with root tips removed after inoculation compared to the control. When tips were removed at or before inoculation, fewer juveniles entered roots and relatively fewer nematodes developed. Penetration levels and development correlated with root tip removal such that progressively fewer nematodes entered roots and relatively greater numbers of nematodes remained undeveloped as the time interval between root ti removal and inoculation was increased.},

	Abstract = {The development of Heterodera schachtii inside roots of a cruciferous host plant grown under monoxenic conditions in an agar medium was observed with video-enhanced contrast light microscopy. One to 6 days after inoculation, roots were excised and processed for electron microscopic observations. Exudates were present on the cuticle surfaces of J 2 and early J 3 juveniles located at feeding sites. Fibrillar exudations were correlated with similar fibrillar patterns in the epicuticle, exocuticle, intermediate zone, and the striated endocuticle. Secretion vesicles assembled at many Golgi sites in the hypodermis, appeared to coalesce and form large electron translucent vesicles in the cytoplasm. We propose that secretion vesicles migrate toward the cuticle, contact the plasmalemma and transfer their contents by exocytosis or a similar mechanism to a secretion accumulation site. These contents are associated with cuticle structure and emerge as surface exudations.},

	Abstract = {Homogenates of the anterior regions of Meloidogyne incognita adult females injected into the spleen of Balb/c mice stimulated the production of nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bound to secretory granules formed in the nematode dorsal esophageal gland. Five of these nine MAbs were female-specific and bound to secretory granules in M. incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria, but not to those in M. hapla or Heterodera glycines. None of these nine MAbs recognized antigens in the dorsal gland of second-stage juveniles of the Meloidogyne spp. Two MAbs that bound to secretory granules within the subventral glands of females of M. incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria, but not to those in M. hapla or H. glycines, were obtained from an intrasplenic nitrocellulose implant carrying stylet secretions from M. incognita females. No MAbs to nematode esophageal glands were produced by a subcutaneous implant of nematode stylet secretions on nitrocellulose or through intraperitoneal injection using cyclophosphamide to favor the immune response to homogenates of the anterior region of M. incognita females. Antibodies to nematode nuclei, amphids, esophago-intestinal cells, muscle, and other structures also were produced. All antibody binding was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of nematode specimens. Intrasplenic immunizations required the least time, used small quantities of immunogen, and produced the most desirable MAbs.},

The class C enzyme isolated from H. glycines is similar to that from Meloidogyne arenaria and M. incognita but is somewhat more sensitive to AChE inhibitors such as eserine.

	Abstract = {A survey of the cytogenetic, enzymatic, and DNA variation of root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., involved a total of 19 populations from various hosts in several regions of Spain. Of these, nine populations were identified as M. arenaria, six as M. incognita, three as M. javanica, and one as M. hapla. All M. javanica populations were hypotriploids with 43-46 chromosomes. The M. arenaria populations were hypotriploids with 40-48 chromosomes, except one diploid population with 34. The M. hapla population was a hypotriploid with 43-45 chromosomes. To assess isozyme variation, we assayed 11 enzyme systems. Only three systems showed some variation. Esterase patterns allowed separation of the four Meloidogyne species and two different forms in M. incognita and M. arenaria. Malate dehydrogenase patterns separated M. hapla from the rest of the species. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase separated M. incognita from the other species. Variation at the nucleic acid level was examined with a 1.8-kb mitochondrial DNA probe, IB2-37, which allowed the differentiation of M. incognita, M. arenaria, and M. javanica, after digestion of nucleic acids with either EcoRI or HinfI. Oligonucleotide primers based on IB2-37 were used in polymerase chain reactions. DNA, amplified from 1-10 juveniles, was digested with HinfI and produced patterns identical to those obtained in hybridization experiments. This procedure also allowed separation of M. hispanica and M. microcephala from the four major species. These results demonstrate that enzyme phenotyping and nucleic acid analysis provide consistent species identification in Meloidogyne.},

	Abstract = {Heterodera schachtii and H. cruciferae are sympatric in California and frequently occur in the same field upon the same host. We have investigated the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of nematode DNA sequences to differentiate H schachtii and H. cruciferae and to assess genetic variability within each species. Single, random oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers were used to generate PCR-amplified fragments, termed RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers, from genomic DNA of each species. Each of 19 different random primers yielded from 2 to 12 fragments whose size ranged from 200 to 1,500 bp. Reproducible differences in fragment patterns allowed differentiation of the two species with each primer. Similarities and differences among six different geographic populations of H. schachtii were detected. The potential application of RAPD analysis to relationships among nematode populations was assessed through cluster analysis of these six different populations, with 78 scorable markers from 10 different random primers. DNA from single cysts was successfully amplified, and genetic variability was revealed within geographic populations. The use of RAPD markers to assess genetic variability is a simple, reproducible technique that does not require radioisotopes. This powerful new technique can be used as a diagnostic tool and should have broad application in nematology.},

	Abstract = {Traditional morphological methods of Meloidogyne identification have been unsuccessful in distinguishing three South Carolina, USA Meloidogyne arenaria race 2 populations - Govan, Pelion, and Florence. These populations differ greatly in reproductive rate and aggressiveness on soybean hosts. Total genomic DNA from eggs of each population was digested with the restriction endonuclease Eco RI and Southern hybridization analyses were performed with single-copy and interspersed multi-copy cloned probes. Probes were isolated from a genomic library of Eco RI, M. arenaria DNA fragments cloned into pUC8. One probe, designated pE1.6A, when hybridized to Southern blots of M. arenaria genomic DNAs, displayed an interspersed repetitive pattern, and the RFLPs distinguished the Govan population from the Pelion and Florence populations. Another clone, pE6.0A, carrying moderately repeated sequences, distinguished the Pelion and Florence isolates. This communication demonstrates the utility of genomic RFLP analysis for distinguishing populations of the same race within the same species. To test the possible utility of these moderately repeated sequence probes for detecting the presence of nematode DNA in DNA samples from roots inoculated with varying numbers of nematodes, dot blot hybridization analyses were performed. It is possible to detect as few as 30 nematodes per root sample with these cloned probes.},

	Abstract = {Plant breeders and nematologists have developed improved cultivars of important crop species with resistance to plant-parasitic nematodes. The effectiveness of these breeding efforts has depended on the availability of efficient screening procedures, identification of adequate sources of durable resistance, nature of the nematode feeding habit, and knowledge of the inheritance of resistance. These factors determine to a large degree the breeding method and potential success of the research. Systematic searches for nematode resistance have identified resistant germplasm lines within crop species or from related species. When the resistance gene(s) is from related species, incongruity barriers or sterility of the resulting hybrids often must be overcome. In these situations, backcrossing is usually necessary to incorporate the resistance gene(s) and recover the desirable commercial traits of the crop species. If the resistance gene(s) is present within the crop species, the choice of breeding method depends on the inheritance of the resistance, type of screening procedure, and other important breeding objectives for the species. In the future, plant molecular biologists and geneticists will make available novel sources of nematode resistance through incorporation of transgenes from other genera. These efforts will likely require conventional breeding strategies before commercial utilization of an improved resistant cultivar.},

The present study represents the first complete reconstruction of synaptonemal complexes in the genus Achlya. The occurrence of both zygonema and pachynema was simultaneous in antheridia and oogonia. Pachytene nuclei of antheridia and oogonia are small, 13-mu-m3 in volume, and the average length of the synaptonemal complexes ranged from 1.9 to 4.4-mu-m. Lateral elements at zygotene ranged from 1.2 to 4.7-mu-m. Both ends of each synaptonemal complex were attached randomly to the nuclear envelope, so a bouquet formation was not observed at pachytene. In A. recurva, the dimensions of the synaptonemal complex were as follows: overall width = 270 nm; the lateral elements = 75 nm each in width and the central region = 120 nm. There was no central element and associated transverse filaments, which may be associated with development of alternative reproductive strategies other than amphimixis, as in nematodes. Of the 15 synaptonemal complexes present, only the one carrying the nucleolus organizer region could be clearly identified from one nucleus to the next. The nucleolar organizer region was on the average 0.75-mu-m from the telomere in both zygotene and pachytene nuclei. There were an average of three recombination nodules in each nucleus. Synaptonemal complexes have been reported in over 80 different species of fungi and related protista. Karyotypic evolution in the oomycetes and fungi may be the result of polyploidization, followed by cytogenetic diversification involving aneuploidy and differing degrees of polyploidy. Such a sequence of events could explain the apparent polyphyletic formation of this group.},

Growth of Wright soybean was stimulated by VAM fungi and suppressed by SCN in greenhouse experiments. The effect of VAM fungi on SCN varied with time. Numbers of SCN in roots and soil were decreased by VAM fungi by as much as 73% at the highest SCN inoculum level through 49 days after planting. Later, however, SCN numbers were usually comparable on mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants. Soil P fertility generally had no effect on SCN.

In one environment, soybean yields in aldicarb-treated plots were lower (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) than in nontreated plots. Cultivar x aldicarb interactions were detected in only one environment. Resistant cultivars yielded higher than susceptible cultivars in 13 of 15 environments. Final populations (Pf) of H. glycines were generally unaffected by aldicarb treatment; however, in 3 environments Pf were significantly higher, whereas in 2 other environments Pf were significantly lower in aldicarb-treated plots than in nontreated plots.},

	Abstract = {Because the race scheme for Heterodera glycines was expanded recently from 5 to 16 races, the occurrence and distribution of races in Illinois need clarification. Forty-four populations of H. glycines were collected from sites in 23 of the 88 infested countries. Populations were tested using the differential soybean lines Pickett 71, Peking, PI 88788, and PI 90763. Lee 68 and Williams 82 were used as standards. Seedlings were grown in 7.5-cm-d clay pots and inoculated with 1,000 eggs and second-stage juveniles obtained from H. glycines-infested field soil. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 22-28 C. After 1 month, the number of first-generation white females that developed on each differential was determined and the race of the population was designated. Twenty-eight populations were race 3, twelve were race 1, two were race 5, one was race 2, and one was race 4. Populations of races 3 and 1 were widely distributed in the state. In 26 of the 28 race determinations, race designations using Williams 82 and Lee 68 were the same, indicating that if Lee 68 is not available, Williams 82 may be a suitable alternative for race tests done in the north central United States.},

Tissue-culture quality agar and medium conditions optimized for hydroponic root culture were essential for successful infections. Detailed in-vivo observations were made inside Arabidopsis roots during the early infection stages of M. incognita and during complete development of H. schachtii. Seventy-four different ecotypes of Arabidopsis were screened for their susceptibility towards H. schachtii resulting in a range of infection rates. None of the ecotypes tested showed complete resistance in vitro. The use of Arabidopsis as a host for plant-parasitic nematodes will provide a new model system for the molecular genetic analysis of this interaction.},

Crop rotation experiments designed to develop management systems were initiated in 1956. Two or more years in production of a nonhost crop resulted in decreases of the nematode to low or undetectable levels with acceptable subsequent yields of soybean (Glycine max). Because of almost complete dependence on resistant cultivars and (or) nematicides for nematode control, crop rotation experiments were not conducted from 1962 to 1980. Research on control of H. glycines, beginning in 1981, emphasized biological and ecological aspects of the nematode in order to determine cropping systems that restrict the nematode to nondamaging levels. Mortality during embryogenesis was high at temperatures above 30 C. Hatching of eggs occurs readily in May and June. Postinfection development takes 2-3 weeks at weekly mean temperatures of 22-29 C and is slow above and below those temperatures. Egg production is high during the late growing season. Some cultural practices such as planting early maturing cultivars in mid-to-late June and rotation with a nonhost effectively keeps populations at low levels.},

	Abstract = {Forty-two soybean (Glycine max) cultivars representing maturity groups IV - VIII were evaluated for their response to sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium solani, over 3 yr in a field with a history of the disease. Disease severity was assessed weekly from the middle of July through September using a rating scale of 0-5 where 0 = 0%, 1 = 10%, 2 = 11-30%, 3 = 31-70%, 4 = 71-90%, and 5 = > 90% of the leaf area exhibiting foliar symptoms of SDS. Area under the disease progress curve was calculated for each cultivar. The susceptible cultivar Lee 74 was planted adjacent to each cultivar tested and served as a standard for comparison of disease levels. Disease progress on plants of Lee 74 was used to estimate disease for each of the plots with plants of the test cultivars using the geostatistical technique, "kriging." Estimates of relative amounts of disease were used as covariates in the cultivar analysis. Foliar symptoms of SDS were noted at or shortly after flowering with cultivars of maturity group IV but before flowering with many of the cultivars in maturity groups V-VIII, depending on the year. Significant differences in disease development between cultivars occurred at the R3 growth stage and were more distinct at the R6 growth stage. Cultivar rankings at R3 were generally highly correlated to their rankings at R6. Most cultivars had similar levels of disease between years and with previous observations. However, some cultivars had significant differences in disease development between years. Disease development in a few cultivars differed markedly with previous observations. These differences appeared to be associated with the response of the cultivar to race 6 of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, the predominate race in the test field. Cultivars susceptible to race 6 were susceptible to SDS and those that were moderately resistant or resistant to race 6 had low levels of SDS. With other cultivars, susceptibility to SCN was not related to susceptibility to SDS.},

Lowest numbers of H. glycines juveniles were associated with Leflore soybean and the corn-soybean rotation. Numbers of M. arenaria juveniles were highest with Leflore and lowest with Braxton and Brim soybean. The sorghum-soybean rotation resulted in slightly higher numbers of M. arenaria juvenile populations than soybean monoculture or the corn-soybean rotation.

Field and greenhouse data were collected from Oklahoma and Kansas populations on vegetative characters, allocation to reproduction, and relative growth and competitive success along resource gradients.  Except for greater susceptibility to leaf rust by males, there were no significant differences between males and females in vegetative characters, total biomass, or reproductive effort.  Field studies of spatial distributions of males and females failed to show any relation to soil, topography, or soil moisture.  In a 45-month greenhouse experiment starting at the seedling stage, the relative growth and competitive success of randomly paired individuals showed no evidence for differential competitive success or for niche-partitioning of males and females.  The "outcrossing advantage" and subsequent sexual specialization of the female inflorescence appear to be the major factors underlying this dimorphic system.},

Four cultivars of annual ryegrass, wheat, and rye, and a fallow control were seeded on a Suffolk sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Hapuldult) soil in each of three years. Nematode-susceptible soybeans were seeded following forage removal. Soil samples for nematode counts were taken immediately before soybean harvest each year. In another experiment, one cultivar each of annual ryegrass, wheat, and rye, and a fallow control were followed by three soybean cultivars selected for differing nematode susceptibility. Grass cultivars did not affect nematode populations under succeeding soybean. The only nematodes affected by grass species in either experiment were Pratylenchus spp., Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, and Tylenchorhynchus claytoni (Kofoid and White) Chitwood. Nematode population means were usually low following ryegrass and high following the fallow control.

	Abstract = {The effects of different planting dates on infestation of susceptible soybean cvs. Essex and Lee by Heterodera glycines were investigated during three growing seasons. Early planting dates of susceptible soybean cvs. at lower temperatures resulted in smaller nodules, lower nematode populations and field infestations, lower soybean cyst nematode (SCN) disease ratings, taller plants, and higher yields. SCN induced more nodules on soybean roots at 14 May plantings date. The development of SCN race 5 in the field was associated closely with soil temperature. The infestation of susceptible soybean cvs. at early planting dates by H. glycines greatly affected the agronomic performance of these cvs. in the field. Susceptible soybean cvs grown in infested soil with SCN race 5 planted earlier than the recommended planting dates escaped severe infestation of SCN in the field.},

	Abstract = {Tolerance to soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, has been identified in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and has potential as a management strategy to limit SCN yield suppression. Little information is available on the growth and morphology of roots of tolerant soybean cultivars parasitized by SCN. This study was conducted to compare root and vegetative responses of a moderately tolerant soybean, 'Wright', with an intolerant soybean, 'Bragg', to parasitism by SCN. In 1986, Bragg and Wright soybean was grown in the University of Georgia rhizotron in rooting medium infested with SCN Race 3 at initial population densities (P(i)) of 0, 1000, or 10 000 eggs/L. Measurements were made of soybean root growth and development, vegetative and reproductive growth stage, leaf number, flower and pod numbers, and nematode activity (development and infection). Number of growing roots on Bragg at P(i) 10 000 was suppressed throughout the season, whereas root growth of Wright was stimulated by the presence of SCN. Although not statistically significant, root lengths followed these same trends. Seed yield of Bragg was progressively suppressed as P(i) increased, in contrast to that of Wright which was suppressed at P(i) 1000, but was not suppressed further at P(i) 10 000. Vegetative development of Bragg was suppressed at P(i) 10 000 compared to P(i) 0 from 18 and 39 d after planting (DAP), respectively, in contrast to Wright which was unaffected. Reproductive development of Bragg at P(i) 10 000 was also suppressed between 79 and 133 DAP. The stimulation of root development of Wright in the presence of SCN was probably critical to maintenance of vegetative and reproductive development.},

Pathogenicity associations within each population also were very similar during this period.  Differences between the eastern and prairie populations became evident after the introduction of leaf rust-resistant cultivars in the prairies in 1937.  A series of resistant cultivars was released in this region, placing a continuous selection pressure on the corresponding virulences in the prairie leaf rust population.  This resulted in cycles of selection and displacement of virulent and avirulent races, respectively, in this region.  Susceptible cultivars continued to be grown in the eastern region, and the leaf rust population in this region has since had a different succession of UN races than the prairie population.  The eastern and prairie populations of P. r. tritici are currently very different in terms of distinct phenotypes.  These regional populations most likely originated from a common, introduced population of P. r. tritici, and the regional differences have resulted from the use of leaf rust-resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars.},

Numbers of SCN cysts, eggs, and second-stage juveniles were unaffected by wheat as opposed to winter fallow. Delay in soybean planting associated with double-cropping wheat, however, allowed for a significant decline in the numbers of SCN between early May and late June. Midseason densities of early May soybean plantings were greater than those of mid-June to late June plantings. Soybean yields were greater with a late May planting than with either early May or late June planting in 1985. Late soybean plantings tended to have greater densities of SCN eggs at soybean maturity, probably a result of less SCN damage in these plots. Neither soybean planting date nor wheat affected soybean yields in 1986. Delayed soybean planting may reduce the damage potential of SCN by reducing inoculum density at planting, but wheat has no direct effect on SCN.},

Nodulation of susceptible Lee 68 soybeans was suppressed by race 1, regardless of the bacterial strain. In contrast, nodulation of resistant soybeans was less affected despite comparable penetration rates of juveniles and subsequent necrosis in the roots. Nodules from race 3-infected Lee 68 soybean had similar ultrastructures of bacteroid-containing cells and univaded cells and protein patterns in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, but reduced heme contents and nitrogen-fixation efficiency, as compared with those from the controls. Emerging nodules from race 1-infected plants accumulated phytoferritin and starch granules and had altered protein patterns in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, when compared to nodules of similar size from control or race 3-infected plants.

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) (SCN) is a major pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in the southeastern USA. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of wet and dry silt loam and clay soils on SCN development and corresponding soybean yield response in a greenhouse study. 'Tracy-M' soybean was grown in pots that contained either Dubbs silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludalf) or Sharkey clay (very fine, montmorillonitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept) surface soils that were watered to maintain adequate soil water potential (SWP) (-30 kPa SWP, wet treatment), or had water added at one-half the rate of the adequate treatment (dry treatment). Nematode treatments were either infested or noninfested. Experiments were conducted in 1987, 1988, and 1989, and new soil was infested each year. Number of cysts increased significantly with time in the wet silt loam treatment, stayed the same as the initial infestation in the dry silt loam treatment, and declined significantly in both the wet and dry clay treatments in all years of the study. Infestation by SCN caused a reduction in seed yields in both soils, but the decrease was less in the clay soil. Soil water content in each soil interacted with level of SCN infestation to influence soybean yield. The interaction was not dependent on similar SCN infestation levels between soils, or similar differences in SCN infestation between wet and dry soil treatments within soil. Yield declines associated with SCN infestation were highly correlated with number of seed. These results indicate that SCN will not maintain populations in fine-textured clay soil under greenhouse conditions, nor result in the magnitude of yield decline that often is measured in coarse-textured soil.},

In susceptible plants the first syncytia were observed 4 days after placing the seedlings into a substrate containing nematode cysts. They were located on different root levels. In resistant plants syncytia were first found after 14 days, exclusively in the root maturity zone. In both wheats syncytia consisted mostly of stelar parenchymatic cells. The syncytia induced in roots of Triticum aestivum AUS 10894 were characterized by less immediate contact with the host tracheary elements than the syncytia induced in roots of susceptible Triticum aestivum cv. 'Capa'. In both wheats a stimulation of pericycle cell divisions, giving rise to lateral roots, was found in parts where the syncytia developed.},

	Abstract = {Interior samples of three different Nakhla specimens contain an iron-rich silicate "rust" (which includes a tentatively identified smectite), Ca-carbonate (probably calcite), Ca-sulfate (possibly gypsum or bassanite), Mg-sulfate (possibly epsomite or kieserite), and NaCl (halite); the total abundance of these phases is estimated as < 0.01 weight percent of the bulk meteorite.  Rust veins are truncated and decrepitated by fusion crust and are preserved as faulted segments in partially healed olivine crystals, indicating that the rust is pre-terrestrial in origin.  Because Ca-carbonate and Ca-sulfate are intergrown with the rust, they are also indicated to be of pre-terrestrial origin.  Similar textural evidence regarding origins of the NaCl and Mg-sulfate is lacking.  Impure and poorly crystallized sulfates and halides on the fusion crust of the meteorite suggest leaching of interior (pre-terrestrial) salts from the interior after Nakhla arrived on Earth but coincidental addition of these same salts by terrestrial contamination cannot be excluded.  At least the clay-like silicate "rust," Ca-carbonate, and Ca-sulfate were formed by precipitation from water-based solutions on the Nakhla parent planet although temperature and pressure conditions of aqueous precipitation are unconstrained by currently available data.  It is possible that aqueous alteration on the parent body was responsible for the previously observed disturbance of the Rb-Sr geochronometer in Nakhla at or near 1.3 Ga.},

Petrographic examination of the affected concrete zones leads to the conclusion that the damaging process is the formation of extensive masses of jarosite in the contact area between the cement paste and the reacting aggregate.

Soybean size decreased as soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe (Nematoda: Heteroderidae), initial population densities increased. Plant species composition of the soybean canopy was affected by weed population densities. Mortality of H. zea larvae due to parasitism and infection with entomopathogens was greater in closed canopy and (or) weedy soybeans than in very open and (or) weed free soybeans. Predation and parasitism of corn earworm eggs were similar across nematode and weed density treatments. Natural enemy populations increased to highest levels during July in closed canopy and (or) weedy soybeans, coinciding with availability of largest prey population reservoirs. A delay in colonization of very open and (or) weed free soybeans by beneficial arthropods until mid to late August allowed greater H. zea larval survival than in closed canopy and (or) weedy soybeans. Arthropod species richness was generally greatest in closed canopy and (or) weedy soybeans during mid to late July, with differences becoming nonsignificant in August and early September. Mean and maximum ambient temperatures were higher and relative humidities lower in open canopy than in closed canopy plots. These conditions were less favorable for development of pathogens and natural enemies.},

	Abstract = {Field experiments to investigate the interactive effects among corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie); soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; and annual weed species in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) were conducted during 1986-1988 in eastern North Carolina. This study examined the effects of canopy development in soybean on H.zea oviposition and larval establishment as influenced by H. glycines and weed densities. Soybean canopy development was inversely related to increasing initial population density (P(i)) of H. glycines. In general, soybeans with moderate and high H. glycines P(i) levels had more open canopies and consequently had greater H. zea larval populations during mid-to late August than did the 0 and low H. glycines P(i) treatments where soybean canopies were closed. In some field sites, very high H. glycines P(i) levels caused severe stunting and chlorosis, reducing the suitability of these soybeans as a food source for H. zea larvae. Weed-free and moderately weedy soybeans had greater H. zea larval populations than soybeans with high weed densities. Across locations and years, numbers of early developmental stages (egg and early instars) of H. zea were not influenced by H. glycines P(i) or weed density. Number of H. zea late instars were positively correlated with distance between canopies of adjacent rows.},

	Abstract = {A monoxenic resistance test for routine use was developed to determine the resistance of potato genotypes to the cyst nematode Globodera pallida (Stone) Behrens. The basis of the procedure is the aseptic cultivation of the genotypes under test in a nutrient medium in defined conditions. It was possible with it to observe invasion, the development of the nematodes, as well as the dimensions of their feeding cells in the transparent potato roots. Small, quantitative differences, due presumably to the polygenically determined resistance reactions of the genotypes, could be distinguished, and selection for resistance was feasible. For routine trials special procedures were developed using surface sterilisation of potato seed and etiolated sprouts which gave high levels of sterility. The genotypes from seeds could be tested directly, but those from etiolated sprouts had to be prepared by stem cutting. A root system was obtained which correlated with known ratings. Each genotype established from seed and etiolated shoots, developed at different rates, as did their root systems, and no definite timespan could be set before nematode introduction. Growing the cultivars under light before the test resulted in faster root development (Table 2), and a higher nematode infestation than in darkness (Figure 4). The time for nematode inoculation was determined by a rating system based on the location of the perimeter of the root system (Figure 5). In this way physiological factors and the individual growth rate of each genotype were allowed for, with the aim of assessing possibly high levels of nematode infection. At the end of the test the seedling genotypes can be removed from sterile culture and grown on in pots. Where genotypes form minitubers (Table 1) it is possible to proceed early to the next stage in cultivation or to store them trouble-free.},

End-of-season juvenile soil populations of M. arenaria and of H. glycines were reduced by 95-100% where either of the tropical legumes was grown. Yields of seven soybean cultivars (Braxton, Centennial, Gordon, Kirby, LeFlore, Ransom, Stonewall) increased significantly in plots planted with jointvetch or indigo the previous year. The magnitude of the yield increment depended on the soybean cultivar; the average increases in yields for all cultivars were 46% and 55% following jointvetch and indigo, respectively. At-plant application of aldicarb (17 g a.i./100 m of row in a 20-cm-wide band) was most effective in increasing yields of soybean grown in monoculture but was generally ineffective in soybean grown in rotation.

Except for Braxton, aldicarb did not increase yield of any cultivar in the sorghum-soybean plots; however, yield of 'Kirby' and 'Leflore' were increased in the monoculture system. Yields of all cultivars were higher in the sorghym-soybean plots than in those in monoculture. Yield increases in response to the sorghum-soybean system compared with continuous soybean varied from 31% for 'Kirby' to 231% for 'Stonewall'; the average increase in yield for all cultivars was 85%. Populations of H. glycines juveniles in soil samples taken 6 weeks before harvest were lowest in plots with 'Leflore'. In general, numbers of juveniles were lower in plots with the sorghum-soybean rotation than in the monoculture plots.

	Abstract = {The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, is a major pathogen in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and although resistance cultivars have been developed, new races of H. glycines build up that are capable of damaging the resistant cultivars. The use of tolerant and susceptible genotypes of soybean which support SCN development and reproduction without serious plant growth reductions, is a promising method for limiting SCN yield suppression without creating selection pressure for new races of this nematode. A field study was conducted for 2 yr to determine the effect of SCN initial population (Pi) densities on soybean root and shoot development in the intolerant and susceptible cultivar, Bragg, and the moderately tolerant cultivar, Wright. Shoot and root growth was stimulated at the low Pi but reduced at high Pi in both years. Harvest seed weight showed a similar response in 1986, but declined steadily with increasing Pi in 1987 when there was less rainfall. The moderately tolerant cultivar, Wright appeared to be a smaller, more efficient plant than the tolerant cultivar, Bragg. Wright had a smaller root system than Bragg, but the roots in the top 0.15 m exhibited compensatory growth in rsponse to early infection by SCN whereas Bragg root growth was suppressed. Wright also had a proportionately deeper root system, compared to Bragg, and this may be part of the mechanism of tolerance.},

	Abstract = {Selection and inbreeding of soybean cyst nematodes increased populations ability to produce cysts of some soybean lines with concurrent decrease in numbers of cysts on other soybean lines: evidence that some alleles for incompatibility were either linked or at the same loci. Some responses could be explained only by linkage of nematode genes for avirulence. Linkage of nematode alleles for incompatibility could be involved when selection increased numbers of cysts on several lines even though the usual interpretation has been that the lines had some of the same genes for resistance. Most of the lines used in this study may have fewer alleles for incompatibility than most "resistant" lines. Use of these lines with fewer genes for resistance should help in the identification of individual alleles for incompatibility necessary for resolving the allelism and/or linkage of these nematode genes.},

	Abstract = {Many of the progeny types used to estimate quantitative trait locus (QTL) parameters can be replicated, e.g., recombinant inbred, doubled haploid, and F3 lines. These parameters are estimated using molecular markers or QTL genotypes estimated from molecular markers as independent variables. Experiment designs for replicated progeny are functions of the number of replications per line (r) and the number of replications per QTL genotype (n). The value of n is determined by the size of the progeny population (N), the progeny type, and the number of simultaneously estimated QTL parameters (q - 1). Power for testing hypotheses about means of QTL genotypes is increased by increasing r and n, but the effects of these factors have not been quantified. In this paper, we describe how power is affected by r, n, and other factors. The genetic variance between lines nested in QTL genotypes (sigma 2n:q) is the fraction of the genetic variance between lines (sigma 2n) which is not explained by simultaneously estimated intralocus and interlocus QTL parameters (phi 2Q); thus, sigma 2n:q = sigma 2n - phi 2Q. If sigma 2n:q not equal to 0, then power is not efficiently increased by increasing r and is maximized by maximizing n and using r = 1; however, if sigma 2n:q = 0, then r and n affect power equally and power is efficiently increased by increasing r and is maximized by maximizing N.r. Increasing n efficiently increases power for a wide range of values of sigma 2n:q.sigma 2n:q = 0 when the genetic variance between lines is fully explained by QTL parameters (sigma 2n = phi 2Q).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Fayette was developed from William .times. PI 88,788 for resistance to the soybean cyst nematode. Williams is susceptible to both races of P. manshurica. The resistance to these races in Fayette was probably transferred from PI 88,788. The gene symbol Rpm2 was assigned to the gene in PI 88,788. The resistant parents were symptomless, but in crosses of a parent susceptible to race 2 or race 33 with a parent resistant to that race, the F1 progeny developed small flecks. The segregation ratios in the F2 and F3 progenies indicate that homozygous resistant plants are symptomless and heterozygous resistant plants develop small flecks. The F1 progeny from resistant .times. resistant crosses were symptomless when inoculated with race 2, indicating an epistatic effect of the two resistance genes at different loci.},

	Abstract = {Soyabean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines inbreds were developed by 10 successive single cyst transfers, with concurrent selection on the resistant soyabean lines PI 88788 and PI 90763. Five of the SCN inbreds developed on each soyabean line were evaluated for numbers of cysts (white females) per plant of 17 other lines reported to be resistant to one population of race 3, to determine if they had some of the same or different genes for resistance compared with PI 88788 and PI 90763. The cv. Lee 74 was included to standardize the results. Five of the lines may have some of the same genes for resistance as PI 88788 whereas 5 may be similar to PI 90763. The sampling effect of inbreeding indicated that the lines within these 2 groups may not be genetically identical. Peking and Pickett 71 tended to have intermediate to high numbers of cysts with both sets of inbreds; frequently Peking was similar to PI 90763 and Pickett 71, but this does not imply genetic similarity. These results suggest that some of the PI lines may have resistance genes differing from those of the other PI lines. These PI lines should provide additional germplasm to broaden genetic diversity for SCN resistance in cultivar development. Some other gross genetic similarities based on other data are discussed.},

The effect of Pensacola bahiagrass in rotation with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) on M. arenaria was studied in 1986 and 1987 in a field at the Wiregrass substation near Headland, Alabama. Each year soil densities of second-stage juveniles of M. arenaria, determined near peanut harvest, were 96-98% lower under bahiagrass than under peanut. In 1987 peanut yields in plots following bahiagrass were 27% higher than in plots under peanut monoculture. Juvenile population densities in bahiagrass-peanut plots were 41% lower than in plots with continuous peanut. Using bahiagrass for reducing population densities of M. arenaria and increasing peanut yield was as effective as using aldicarb at the recommended rates for peanut.},

Fagopyron eseulentum, Cyamopsis tetragonoloba, and Cucurbita pepo were hosts to the two Meloidogyne spp. but were nonhosts to H. glycines. Meloidogyne arenaria and M. incognita galled but reproduced poorly in the roots of three types of Amaranthus cruentus, and low densities of these two Meloidogyne spp. (< 10 second-stage juveniles/100 cm(3) soil) occurred in soil cultivated with this crop. In a field study no juveniles of M. arenaria determined at peanut harvest were recovered from plots with Ricinus communis, Gossypium hirsutum, Aeschynomene americana, C. fasiculata, or S. indicum. Peanut plots averaged 120 juveniles/100 cm(3) soil. Application of aldicarb (12 kg a.i./ha broadcast) in peanut resulted in an average of 27 juveniles/100 cm(3) soil. Several crops were as effective as aldicarb treatment for reducing soil juvenile population densities of M. arenaria.},

	Abstract = {A 3-yr field study was conducted on a soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Inchinohe) infested Tiptonville silt loam (fine, silty, mixed, thermic Typic Argiudoll) to evaluate the response to K of three soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars with different levels of SCN resistance. Essex (SCN susceptible) yielded significantly less than Forrest (resistant to races 1 and 3) and Bedford (resistant to races 3 and 4) the third year. The SCN cyst count of Essex plots at harvest was significantly higher (PR > 0.05) than Forrest and Bedford the third year only. There were no significant differences in yield within cultivars due to K treatment. There were no differences between SCN cyst counts, preplant and plant maturity, within cultivar, due to K treatment. The leaf K content of Bedford was higher than Essex and Forrest in two of the three years, suggesting the need to determine if plant K status is related to specific SCN race resistance or a function of translocation from the root to the plant leaf. The leaf N and Cl contents of Essex were higher than Forrest and Bedford. Leaf Cl was negatively correlated to yield of Essex the second year when leaf Cl was the highest. During the two years evaluated, leaf Cl of Essex only was positively correlated to K treatment. The cultivar Essex appears to be a Cl accumulator and cultivars Forrest and Bedford Cl excluders. Leaf Scorch observed during the high temperature of the 1983 growing season was attributed to Cl toxicity. Additional research is needed to determine if Cl accumulation characteristics and SCN race resistance are genetically linked. Knowledge of Cl accumulation characteristics of soybean cultivars offers the opportunity to select those cultivars that will insure maximum economic yield under a wide range of fertilization practices and soil environments.},

	Abstract = {Seven types of progeny are described which can be used in detection of linkage between marker loci and quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a cross between two inbred lines. Three types of progeny: recombinant inbred lines (RI); doubled haploid lines (DH); and S1 lines can be used to detect linked main effects, d. DH and RI lines can be used to detect smaller effects than S1 lines. However, S1 lines can also be used to detect within-population dominance effects, h. The smallest d detectible is in the range of 1/2 to 1/12 the size of the corresponding LSD(0.05) for the quantitative trait, using 100 lines and 6 replicates. The smallest h detectible is 3{\^a}€``4 times this size. Four types of progeny can be used to detect differences in the dominance behavior of alleles within the population relative to an allele in another inbred line (P4: DH lines x P4; RI lines x P4; either F2 x P4 or S1 lines x P4; and progeny generated by crossing (F1 x P3) x P4. Dominance differences in the range of 1 1/4 to 1/6 the size of the corresponding LSD(0.05) are routinely detectible using 100 lines and 6 replicates. Increasing the numbers of progeny evaluated or the number of replicates allows for the detection of relatively smaller linked effects.},

	Abstract = {Soybean cyst nematode (1Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) (SCN) is a serious pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in the southern USA. A major portion of the U.S. soybean collection has not been screened for races of SCN. Approximately 9000 soybean plant introductions (PIs) were screened for their reaction to SCN races 4 and 5 in the greenhouse. The seedlings were grown in soil infested with SCN, and white females on the roots were counted. We found 21 PIs with some level of resistance to either race 4 or 5. A total of seven resistant, three moderately resistant, and two moderately susceptible PIs for race 4 were identified. Two PI's were heterogeneous for resistant and moderately resistant reactions. For race 5, seven PIs were resistant, two showed moderate resistance, two were moderately susceptible, whereas one segregated for resistant and moderately resistant reactions. All PIs showing resistance to races 4 or 5 were earlier reported to be resistant to race 3 and are in either Maturity Group II, III, or IV. PI 437654 was resistant to both races 4 and 5. In additional tests, it was found to be resistant to five races (races 1 through 5) of SCN. PI 437654 is the only PI resistant to all five recognized races of SCN and would be a good source in resistant cultivar development. These PIs are available to the researchers from the USDA soybean germplasm collection.},

	Abstract = {The three test locations represent very different situations with regards to endemic nematode populations. Elberta has probably the worst situation, where both RKN [root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp.] and SCN [soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines] occur in large numbers. Economic yields [of soybean, Glycine max] probably cannot be made under these circumstances without a nematicide even with the most resistant cultivar. However, the effects of the nematicide and genetic resistance were generally additive, as evidenced by the general lack of a significant cultivar .times. nematicide treatment interaction for seed yield. Highest yields were generally obtained with cultivars that had the broadest spectrum of nematode resistance, regardless of nematicide treatment. These experiments have examined only two aspects of plant-parasitic nematode management in soybean: resistant varieties and nematicide use. The nematicide used in these experiments (EDB) has been banned by EPA action. Other alternative nematicides may or may not provide the same degree of control. Inclusion of management practices, particularly rotation with nonhost crops, and for SCN, rotations involving susceptible and resistant varieties to stabilize populations, may enhance productivity.},

Aldicarb significantly (P = 0.05) reduced nematode populations in only two cases: M. arenaria in Centennial soybean in the Wiregrass site and M. incognita in Bedford soybean in a Tennessee Valley site. No significant difference (P = 0.05) in mean percentage main stem or petiole girdling by threecornered alfalfa hopper (Spissistilus festinus) or in mean number of plants damaged by lesser cornstalk borer (Elasmopalpus lignosellus) occurred among treatments in any experiment. Soybean yields were significantly (P = 0.05) increased in only two cases: in the nematode susceptible Essex and Cobb cultivars planted in the Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast sites, respectively. Unusually dry 1986 weather conditions may have reduced the activity of aldicarb.},

	Abstract = {Eighteen hosts were inoculated with each of four races of Heterodera glycines. A discriminant function analysis of the reactions of these races to these hosts demonstrated that these races could be separated but not consistently. Then 33 H. glycines populations collected from 13 states and five obtained from Japan were tested on differential hosts. The number of variants discriminated within these 38 populations depended on the number of differentials and the rating system used. When five differentials were used with a (+) or (-) rating system there were six "races," but when 13 differentials were used with a (+) or (-) system there were 25 physiological groups. If an index rating system was used there were 36 groups. Apparently H. glycines is a very variable species and delineation of races varies with criteria chosen.},

	Abstract = {Resistance to soyabean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines) is complex and involves multiple unlinked genes. To identify genes for SCN resistance, 4 distinct soyabean F2 populations and one recombinant inbred population segregating for resistance were analysed using RFLP markers. Among all the populations, 4 independent loci were significantly associated with SCN resistance. One of these loci, located in linkage group G, behaved as a major partial resistance gene and was common to all the populations studied. This locus explained at least 49% of the total variation in resistance (based on r-square estimates) in one population (PI209332 x Evans) and between 23 and 45% of the variation in resistance in the remaining populations. The locus mapped to a specific interval defined by two flanking RFLP markers (Bng173 and Bng122) approximately 12 cM apart. This information was used to characterize 147 F4 and F5 lines derived from 16 crosses. The lines were assayed in parallel in greenhouse SCN tests. Selection for the resistant parent allele on the basis of DNA markers identified lines with, on average, a 43% decrease in SCN index. Moreover, marker selection uncovered lines with interesting crossovers very tightly linked to the SCN resistance gene. These crossovers may lead to lines with increased yield, together with high levels of resistance.},

	Abstract = {During the past several years, we have developed a forward genetic system using the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines - SCN) as a model parasite. Forward genetic analysis has revealed that the parasite contains multiple unlinked loci that enable it to evade or circumvent host resistance genes, termed ror genes for "Reproduction On a Resistant" host. These individual ror genes appear in either dominant or recessive states. Controlled crosses have been performed between several SCN strains. Segregation analyses have revealed that inheritance of parasitic ability is Mendelian in nature. The genes controlling parasitic ability on a specific host differential appear to be unlinked loci. The SCN gene controlling ability to parasitize PI 88788 is inherited as a dominant allele, whereas the genes conferring parasitic ability on PI 90763 and Pickett are recessive. Genetic mapping of these loci places them at the ends of separate linkage groups, known to be recombinationally active areas in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of one of these areas in H. glycines reveals the presence of mobile genetic elements closely associated with the Ror-1 locus. A genetic map of the H. glycines genome has been constructed. The 92.5 Mb genome has nine linkage groups. Construction of a physical map by BAC fingerprinting is under way and will be complete soon. In addition to the ror genes, we have placed ESTs on the map, including those with homology to C. elegans.},

	Abstract = {A chromosomal region on molecular linkage group G in the soybean cultivar Forrest underlies co-inheritance of field resistance to sudden-death syndrome caused by F. solani f.sp. glycines and soybean cyst nematode (SCN) race 3. A high-density genetic map was constructed around the Rhg1 and Rhg4 loci that underlie SCN resistance. Seven recombinants were positioned in a 150-kbp interval containing Rhg1. Candidate gene sequences for Rhg1 and Rhg4 were isolated. A leucine rich repeat sequence (LRR), a trans-membrane spanning domain, and a kinase domain were isolated. The identified gene shows high homology to the Xa21 rice disease resistance gene and to an Arabidopsis receptor-like kinase. The Forrest allele contains 76 leucines in 13 extra-cellular GXXP motifs and a kinase on the intracellular domain. A gene closely homologous to Rhg1 is found in the Forrest Rhg4 interval. This gene duplication and the large number of LRRs imply Rhg genes function by dimerization, which may explain variation in host-pathogen recognition.},

	Abstract = {Marker assisted selection for resistance is used for millions of selections annually. We have developed methods for high-throughput selection in soyabean for 5 genes for resistance to soyabean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) and 7 for resistance to sudden death syndrome (SDS, Fusarium solani f.sp. glycines). However, the efficiency of marker selection is limited by using linked markers instead of the genes themselves. We have developed markers from gene sequences following positional cloning of Rhg1, Rhg4 (for resistance to SCN) and Rfs2 (for resistance to SDS). The gene alleles are much more useful than conventional markers. Isolating the remaining genes will be challenging without a whole genome sequence for soyabean. Physical map-based sequencing of gene-rich islands of complex genomes provides an alternative strategy to whole genome sequencing. During the last 3 years, we have developed a fingerprint-based method and physical maps of the soyabean genome, and integrated it with gene maps. The soyabean physical map is most highly developed for linkage group G where 10 contigs encompass the chromosome. These are being used to identify gene rich islands by cDNA hybridization and sequence the gene rich islands within the chromosome. Four genes for resistance were mapped to a 1240-kbp contig. A 300-kbp region of the contig was sequenced to isolate the Rhg1 and Rfs2. Using genetic markers, we mapped 2 genes to a second 300-kbp interval of the same contig, Rfs6 and Rfs1. Integrating EST libraries (60% of the genes) and predicted paralogues (40% of the genes) with the soyabean physical map identified this interval as one of several gene-rich islands on linkage group G. The interval was sequenced using anchored BACs from 2 cultivars. A high predicted gene density has been observed (one gene per 7 kbp). Predicted genes have been annotated by position in the genome and presence in EST libraries or in the transcriptome. Comparing cultivar sequences, we have found about one SNP per 2.1 kbp in genomic DNA, but 2-fold more SNPs around resistance genes. Sequencing of 10-Mbp to encompass one chromosome arm, Rfs, Mi, Rps5, Rps6 and white mould resistance QTL is proposed. Contigs were prepared for 1 Mbp of genomic DNA encompassing Rfs4 and Rfs5 on linkage groups C2 and I. Combining genome sequencing and substitution maps will annotate and isolate the 300-400 economically important soyabean genes efficiently within the next decade. Marker assisted selection efficiency will be increased and the yield of new cultivars improved faster than ever before.},
