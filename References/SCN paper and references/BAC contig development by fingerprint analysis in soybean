BAC contig development by fingerprint analysis in soybean.

Abstract

We constructed a soybean bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library suitable for map-based cloning and physical mapping in soybean. This library consists of approximately 40 000 clones (4-5 genome equivalents) stored individually in 384-well microtiter dishes. A random sampling of 224 clones yielded an average insert size of 150 kb, giving a 98% probability of recovering any specific sequence. We screened the library for seven single or very low copy genie or genomic sequences using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and found between one and seven BACs for each of the seven sequences. When testing the library with a portion of the soybean psbA chloroplast gene, we found less than 1% chloroplast DNA representation. We also screened the library for eight different classes of disease resistance gene analogs (RGAs) and identified BACs containing all RGAs except class 8. We arranged nine of the class 1 RGA BACs and six of the class 3 RGA BACs into individual contigs based on fingerprint patterns observed after Southern probing of restriction digests of the member BACs with a class-specific sequence. This resulted in the partial localization of the different multigene family sequences without precise definition of their exact positions. Using PCR-based end rescue techniques and RFLP mapping of BAC ends, we mapped individual BACs of each contig onto linkage group J of the soybean public map. The class 1 contig mapped to the region on linkage group J that contains several disease resistance genes. The class 1 contig extended approximately 400 kb. The arrangement of the BACs within this contig has been confirmed using PCR. One end of the class 1 contig core BAC mapped to two positions on linkage group J and cosegregated with two class 1 RGA loci, suggesting that this segment is within an area of regional duplication.
