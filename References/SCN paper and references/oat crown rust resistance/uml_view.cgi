TI New DArT markers for oat provide enhanced map coverage and global
   germplasm characterization
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Genomic discovery in oat and its application to oat
   improvement have been hindered by a lack of genetic markers common to
   different genetic maps, and by the difficulty of conducting
   whole-genome analysis using high-throughput markers. This study was
   intended to develop, characterize, and apply a large set of oat genetic
   markers based on Diversity Array Technology (DArT).
   Results: Approximately 19,000 genomic clones were isolated from
   complexity-reduced genomic representations of pooled DNA samples from
   60 oat varieties of global origin. These were screened on three
   discovery arrays, with more than 2000 polymorphic markers being
   identified for use in this study, and approximately 2700 potentially
   polymorphic markers being identified for use in future studies. DNA
   sequence was obtained for 2573 clones and assembled into a
   non-redundant set of 1770 contigs and singletons. Of these, 705 showed
   highly significant (Expectation < 10E-10) BLAST similarity to gene
   sequences in public databases. Based on marker scores in 80 recombinant
   inbred lines, 1010 new DArT markers were used to saturate and improve
   the 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' genetic map. DArT markers provided map coverage
   approximately equivalent to existing markers. After binning markers
   from similar clones, as well as those with 99% scoring similarity, a
   set of 1295 non-redundant markers was used to analyze genetic diversity
   in 182 accessions of cultivated oat of worldwide origin. Results of
   this analysis confirmed that major clusters of oat diversity are
   related to spring vs. winter type, and to the presence of major
   breeding programs within geographical regions. Secondary clusters
   revealed groups that were often related to known pedigree structure.
   Conclusion: These markers will provide a solid basis for future efforts
   in genomic discovery, comparative mapping, and the generation of an oat
   consensus map. They will also provide new opportunities for directed
   breeding of superior oat varieties, and guidance in the maintenance of
   oat genetic diversity.

TI A molecular marker map in 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' hexaploid oat (Avena spp.)
   enhanced by additional markers and a robust framework
SO GENOME
AB Molecular mapping of cultivated oats was conducted to update the
   previous reference map constructed using a recombinant inbred (RI)
   population derived from Avena byzantina C. Koch cv. Kanota x Avena
   sativa L. cv. Ogle. In the current work, 607 new markers were scored,
   many on a larger set of RI lines (133 vs. 71) than previously reported.
   A robust, updated framework map was developed to resolve linkage
   associations among 286 markers. The remaining 880 markers were placed
   individually within the most likely framework interval using chi(2)
   tests. This molecular framework incorporates and builds on previous
   studies, including physical mapping and linkage mapping in additional
   oat populations. The resulting map provides a common tool for use by
   oat researchers concerned with structural genomics, functional
   genomics, and molecular breeding.
