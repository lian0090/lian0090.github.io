TI  - A new elicitor of the hypersensitive response in tobacco: a fungal glycoprotein
      elicits cell death, expression of defence genes, production of salicylic acid,
      and induction of systemic acquired resistance.
PG  - 551-60
AB  - A 32 kDa glycoprotein whose effects in tobacco and other Nicotianae mimic a
      typical hypersensitive response, was isolated from Phytophthora megasperma.
      Infiltration of a few nanograms of the protein into leaves caused the formation
      of lesions that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transcripts of 
      genes encoding enzymes of the phenylpropanoid and sesquiterpenoid pathways
      accumulated rapidly after elicitor application followed by salicylic acid
      production. Cellular damage, restricted to the infiltrated zone, occurred only
      several hours later, at a time when expression of PR protein genes was activated.
      After several days systemic acquired resistance was also induced. Thus, tobacco
      plant cells that perceived the glycoprotein generated a cascade of signals acting
      at local, short, and long distances, and causing the coordinate expression of
      specific defence responses in a way similar to hypersensitivity to tobacco mosaic
      virus. The glycoprotein represents a powerful tool to investigate further the
      signals and their transduction pathways involved in induced disease resistance.
      It may also be useful to engineer broad disease protection in a Nicotianae and
      possibly into crop plant species.
